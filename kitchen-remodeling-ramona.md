Ramona is an unincorporated town close to San Diego City near the Pacific Ocean. Its residents love the city’s close proximity to the sea and especially enjoy taking leisurely walks by the sea. Some of the leading activities here are kayaking, surfing, snorkeling and other water sports. In addition, there are many tourists visiting the city for the better part of the year. However, the town’s location next to the ocean can pose some challenges for the city dwellers. This is especially true when natural forces and elements cause the erosion of walls and internal structures. Luckily, Ramona’s favorable year-round climate enables many home renovation projects.

For those looking to carry out a kitchen remodeling Ramona project, <strong>Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel</strong> is the place to turn to. We have been in the building and renovation industry in Ramona for more than 40 years.
