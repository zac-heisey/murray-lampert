<h1 class="mainhead">Second Story Additions San Diego</h1>
With a second story, you can add space without losing valuable landscaping or yard space, and sometimes even capture a view.  At Murray Lampert, our goal as a <strong>second story contractor in San Diego</strong> is to deliver quality, value, and satisfaction.

Our second story addition service begins with an in <a href="http://murraylampert.com/">home remodeling</a> consultation.  One of our residential designers then creates a custom plan based on your individual needs, drafts detailed project specifications and quotes an accurate price.  You will know exactly what is included down the very last detail.

A common area of dissatisfaction for homeowners is cost overruns.  Many times, second story contractors will intentionally under price fixture and finishes and later in the project you find out that your selections are more expensive than anticipated and you are hit with a change orders. When you choose Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel, we assist you in shopping and budgeting upfront so there are no surprises when your second floor construction begins.
<blockquote style="width: 100%;">I am a single female homeowner and wanted a remodel/addition. Naturally, as a woman, I was afraid of being cheated, and as a reserved personality, afraid of being put off while the " squeaky wheels" got all the attention.What I hoped a reputable company like Murray Lampert could do was to treat me the same as any assertive male customer. What I got was beyond my hopes. Murray Lampert actually made me feel like I was their ONLY customer!Beyond the beautiful work that they do, beyond the courteous &amp; thorough workmen with whom they contract, beyond the surprising speed of construction, they will put your mind at ease at every turn so that you are never afraid. To me, that was worth everything.I have another addition planned in the future, and you can be sure Murray Lampert will be my heroes again!
