## Updating Content (using Siteleaf)

### Blog Posts

![Creating a blog post in Siteleaf](https://screencast.com/t/N6RFoajXk)

1) Be sure to set the *Layout* field to `post`. That will get your post looking how it should!

2a) The default *Permalink* setting for new blog posts is `/:title/`. That means whatever title you give your post will also become the slugified url of that post (ex; Title = **Blog Post 1**, Permalink = `example.com/blog-post-1/`)

2b) To customize the URL slug (the last part of the URL) further, you can click on the pencil icon. Just remember to use “pretty” URL structure (no special characters, all lowercase, separate words with hyphens, etc.).

3) Lastly, to avoid URL image path errors, apply the same “pretty URLs” principles to the naming conventions of any uploaded images.
