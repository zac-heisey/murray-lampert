I have been in the construction industry since 1976 doing remodeling both residential and commercial. I have been a project manager for 28 years and before that worked as a finish and framing carpenter.

My projects have ranged from small remodels to custom homes from the ground up. My project have been Â published in major remodeling magazines and won many awards. My hobbies include collecting sports memorabilia. I am an avid baseball fan and Green Bay Packer fan.
