Zach grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Marywood University with a Bachelor of Architecture. He has always been drawn to construction and design from a young age. Working under a general contractor for years has given him a valuable understanding of the day-to-day details involved in putting together a complete set of construction drawings. Zach enjoys the collaborative design process here at [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/) and getting involved with all aspects of a project.

Always curious, Zach is constantly excited to learn new skills and try new things. In his spare time, you can find Zach at the beach surfing, fishing, camping and spending time with friends and family.
