Hope Wortham has had the benefit of being around the design process her entire life. Growing up, she was constantly exposed to residential design through her father's Landscape Architecture firm. These experiences taught her the value of putting the client's vision first; she believes your space should reflect your unique vision and personality, as well as function optimally for how would like to use it.

Hope graduated from San Diego State University, where she earned her Bachelor of Art with a focus in Interior Design with a minor in Sustainability. While in school, she served as the President of San Diego State University’s student chapter of ASID, and was awarded the regional chapter’s Deborah Thomas Memorial Award for meritorious service for her extensive volunteer work. She is not only an active member of ASID, but is also involved with IIDA and USGBC, and is passionate about sustainability and green design.

Outside of her formal education, Hope has also had the opportunity to gain hands-on design experience during her time at several firms, specializing in a range of project types, including [residential interior design](/san-diego-asid-professionals), as well as hospitality, government and healthcare projects. 

Hope now combines her experience with her unique perspective on customer relationships, in order to create spaces that both inspire and reflect the client.
