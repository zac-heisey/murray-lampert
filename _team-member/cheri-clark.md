Cheri joined [Murray Lampert Design Build Remodel](/) in 2015. She works part time in our front office. She retired from her Real Estate career in 2013 so she could travel with her husband. Being a people person she found retirement a little isolating. She says her part time schedule is a perfect combination that allows her time to travel and the ability to work with a great group of people.

In her free time, she enjoys snow skiing, camping, cooking, and hosting family get togethers.
