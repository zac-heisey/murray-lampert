Hannah relocated from San Diego from Northern California. She grew up in a mountain town close to Lake Tahoe where she competed as a ski racer since the age of six. Her ski racing career took her all over the world competing. She competed as part of the University of Nevada-Reno’s NCAA Division 1 team and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English and Photography. Growing up in the new construction industry with her family business, she had an eye for design and experience in construction. She was encouraged her to go back to school and pursue her Interior Design passion in Sacramento at the Art Institute of California where she received a Bachelor’s degree of Science in Interior Design.

Trading her skis for a surfboard, she moved to San Diego to follow her passion of surfing. She also loves to travel with her parents on motorcycles and explore new places in her new home here in San Diego.
