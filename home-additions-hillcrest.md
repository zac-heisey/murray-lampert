Hillcrest is a San Diego community well-known for its modern tendencies, tolerance and diversity. Blending the tradition with modernity, this community is a vibrant and lively place to live. It boasts the charming Heritage Market, which maybe best reflects the relaxed ways of Hillcrest.

Hillcrest is an affluent community, and its residents revel in the housing possibilities it offers. Given Hillcrest’s mild year-round climate, homeowners are seeking to increase the energy-efficiency, functionality and the general appeal of their homes through various home improvement projects.
## Hillcrest Home Additions
When it comes to enhancing space and the overall functionality of a home, home additions are the most efficient way to go. The advantages of home additions cannot be overemphasized. Home additions enable you to add comfort to your living premise. Additionally, you can enhance the resale value of your home through room addition.

More importantly, you can create something unique to your Hillcrest home. If an old tired-looking home structure is becoming sore to your eyes, then considering a home addition is the cost-efficient way to revamp it. However, it is not a simple task and it requires the service of an experienced renovation specialist.

<strong>Murray Lampert</strong> is a <a href="http://murraylampert.com/another-better-business-bureau-torch-award/">4-time winner of BBB Torch Award For Marketplace Ethics</a> and the <a href="http://murraylampert.com/murray-lampert-recognized-among-north-americas-best">winner of GuildQuality’s 2015 Guildmaster Award</a>.  With our <a href="http://murraylampert.com/san-diego-room-additions/">room additions</a> in Hillcrest, you can be sure the appeal and functionality of your home will be transformed to accommodate your needs and requests.
## Your plan details and ideas matter
Each one of us has their unique tastes and preferences, particularly when it comes to additions. Whether you have a fresh design idea or not, we will guide you from start to finish. If you need to add detail to your existing plan, our staff architect will gladly assist you with <a href="http://murraylampert.com/san-diego-architectural-design-services/">ideas for your architectural design</a>.

The secret to a successful room addition project is to design the additions to look as if they were part of the initial structure. The addition that you should adopt must complement your current floor plan. Our experienced and knowledgeable designers can help you find the most attractive and economical additions to your home.

Even the smallest things can count a lot in the final appeal of your home during additions.
