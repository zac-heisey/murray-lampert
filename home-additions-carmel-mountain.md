Carmel Mountain is a San Diego community that is famous for its yearly events organized by the welcoming local residents. These events are a real opportunity for local businesses, organizations, and schools to interact, especially during the famous fall festival.

Carmel Mountain is just the right place to be during Christmas. Every December, a light show called [Holiday Magic at Fairway Village](http://www.fairwayvillagenews.com/) takes place, with more than 80 homes lit to capture the magical holiday spirit.

Carmel Mountain residents mostly go for detached houses, and the tendency to enhance the appeal and functionality of a home is prevalent among local homeowners. One [Carmel Mountain home renovation](/service-locations/carmel-mountain-design-build-and-remodel-services/) project that covers both the need for a more attractive design as well as more space is a home addition project.
