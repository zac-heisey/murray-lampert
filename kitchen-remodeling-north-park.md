What makes North Park stand out is its architecture, reflecting the era of California’s suburban development with its Craftsman cottages and bungalows.

As one of the fastest-growing urban San Diego communities, North Park is seeing a growing trend in home remodeling and renovation. Residents try to keep up to date with the latest housing trends and modernize their homes so that they become more attractive, comfortable and functional. Home improvement projects are diverse, but most homeowners focus first on the kitchen, as the most vital part of a home.

### Our expert designers turn dreams into reality

In order to ensure that the final product is just as our clients imagine it, our designers take a few steps to familiarize themselves with your idea and come up with <a href="http://murraylampert.com/san-diego-architectural-design-services/">a plan of action</a>. The first step is a meeting between the esteemed client and both our designer and architect. After you present us with your idea, we will translate it into the first draft. We will then present you with several designs we come up with based on this draft and our meeting to determine which one is closest to the kitchen you envisioned. Then we discuss the cost and the materials you want us to use, after which we will present you with <a href="http://murraylampert.com/3d-architectural-rendering-services/">plans, 3D renders and even a virtual tour</a> of your new kitchen. This will help you get the final picture of what your new kitchen will look like before we start the construction. After we’ve agreed upon all the parameters, we will create the final design. When we get the green light from the customer, the undertaking can begin. We go into all this detail to ensure that the client knows exactly what they are getting and that there is no margin for error.
