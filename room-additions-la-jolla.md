La Jolla is a friendly San Diego community surrounded by ocean bluffs and beaches on three sides. It is very popular with the tourists because it has so much to offer – there are many cultural activities as well as possibilities for recreation and entertainment. It boasts the historic La Jolla Playhouse and the magnificent Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego.

According to 2008 and 2009 surveys, La Jolla had the highest home prices in America, which is probably why homeowners tend to renovate their homes rather than acquire new ones. Moving to a new house can happen for a number of reasons, most common of which is the need for more space. Given the circumstances, La Jolla residents most often opt for home and room additions to make their homes more functional and also to enhance their visual appeal.
