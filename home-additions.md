    Lampert Design, Build, Remodel’s San Diego room addition services will design

    home addition projects begin with an in-home or virtual consultation by one of
    our residential designers. We believe the only way provide you with an accurate
    quote is by creating a design. After we discuss your needs and enter into a design

    We then accurately design and price your project down to the finish details.<br><br>With
    our home addition remodeling service, you know how much your improvements will
    cost. A common cause of dissatisfaction is when contractors do not properly budget
    for the caliber of fixtures and finishes. Some home addition contractors intentionally
    come in with low priced fixtures and finishes to win a project. Later on they
    make up for the shortfall by accelerating change orders. The design/build process

    finishes on time and within budget.</p><h3>More Than Just a New Room: Adding a

    consultation. One of our residential designers then creates a custom plan based
    on your individual needs, drafts detailed project specifications and quotes an
    accurate price. You will know exactly what is included down the very last detail.<br><br>If
    you''re looking to add space without losing valuable landscaping or yard area,
