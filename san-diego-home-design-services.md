<h1 class="mainhead">San Diego Custom Home Design Services</h1>
An exciting and unique feature offered by Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel is our <strong><a href="http://murraylampert.com">San Diego</a> custom home design services</strong>. With our in house designers and architect, we create innovative and custom new home designs. What that means to you is that instead of hiring an independent architect at a much higher cost to draw up your plans, Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel will listen to your ideas and needs, then our in house architect will create a custom home design within budget.

Our <strong>custom home design service</strong> is the most efficient way to complete your project. After creating the design for your home remodeling project and drafting thorough job specifications, we complete structural engineering (if necessary) and Title 24 energy calculations to obtain the required building permits. Then our production department schedules all the trades and orders the materials needed to complete your project.  This streamlines the entire process so your project runs smoothly and efficiently.
