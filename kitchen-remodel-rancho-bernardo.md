### Kitchen remodel Rancho Bernardo
Rancho Bernardo is a hilly <a href="http://murraylampert.com">San Diego community</a>, which boasts a real treat for all history and wine lovers – the Rancho Bernardo Historical Museum and Bernardo Winery, the oldest winery in Southern California. Visitors can listen to live jazz on Sundays or browse through wonderful little shops.

There are many beautiful golf courses in the community, most popular of which is <a href="http://www.jcgolf.com/oaks.htm">Oaks North Golf Course</a>. Other popular recreational activities include hiking and fishing at picturesque Lake Hodges or Lake Poway.

This San Diego neighborhood is well-known for its red tile-roofed stucco houses, lined throughout the rolling hills. The setting inspires comfort and coziness and it is no wonder the residents are proud of their homes and try to make them even more comfortable and modern. They undertake various remodeling projects to improve their house’s appeal or the functionality of the bathroom or kitchen.
