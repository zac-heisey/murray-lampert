  content: "<h6>Featured &amp; In-Progress Projects</h6><h2>Craftsmanship Meets Conversation.</h2><p>We
    take the time to listen to what our customers really want and then we deliver.
    Along the way, there are many conversations about finishes, design, deadlines,
    and budgets. And in the end, you'll end up with a home that reflects exactly what
    you want. Take a look at some of our featured projects and past work.</p>"
