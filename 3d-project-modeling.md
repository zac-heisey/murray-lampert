Utilizing our state of the art computerized design system, Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel is now offering as part of our design agreement, 3D walk-throughs of your home remodeling project. With our fully detailed 3D color renderings, you can see what your remodel will look like up front, so there are no surprises.

Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel is not just your everyday [design build contractor](/san-diego-home-design-services). We have an architect and designers on staff, combined with some of the latest technologies to make your home improvement project run smoother and give you a better idea of how your project will look once it's completed. Many remodeling companies claim to be full design-build firms. The truth is that many of them outsource their drafting work, losing control of design quality and cost maintenance. Not only do specialize in the early stages of drafting and architectural planning, we also have an experienced design team and project managers, making us truly full service for our clients.

>"We had complete trust with Murray Lampert and they exceeded our expectations. The professionalism exhibited from the very beginning with the design of our project and the review of the contract was so thorough we felt extremely confident we were in the right hands. Communications were exceptional with our project manager, Steve Law and the work ethic of many of the subs was impeccable. The craftsmanship on all elements of our home is outstanding. My husband and I both get up every day and say how much we love our home" - _DAN &amp; JENNIFER - MAJOR RENOVATION - DEL MAR_
