Not only do we employ an architect, we have a design team and project managers making us truly full service for our clients.<a href="/home-remodeling-services/"> Architectural plans, structural engineering, energy efficient designs, permit processing, high quality construction</a>, and advanced <strong>architectural modeling and rendering</strong> capabilities all under one roof.
<blockquote style="width: 100%;">We had complete trust with Murray Lampert and they exceeded our expectations. The professionalism exhibited from the very beginning with the design of our project and the review of the contract was so thorough we felt extremely confident we were in the right hands. Communications were exceptional with our project manager, Steve Law and the work ethic of many of the subs was impeccable. The craftsmanship on all elements of our home is outstanding. My husband and I both get up every day and say how much we love our home
