### What is the next step?

The first step after you’ve contacted us is an in-home consultation with our designers and architects. After you’ve elaborated on whether you would like your kitchen to look modern or traditional, what kind of cabinets and counters you would like, and which appliances you need we will deliver a few initial sketches based on those ideas. When you’ve selected the one that fits your vision the best, we will <a href="http://murraylampert.com/3d-architectural-rendering-services/">create a 3D render</a> and even offer you a virtual tour of your brand new kitchen. After we’ve agreed on all the details, we will give you a free quote as well as set a schedule which will be met without delay.

### Stress-free kitchen remodeling through professional project management

When you hire Murray Lampert to remodel your kitchen you do not have to worry about having to communicate with any outside contractors, as everything will be handled by our professional project managers, whose phone number is the only one you will need throughout the entire process. At the end of the undertaking, we will deliver all the documentation, blueprints, permits and a single invoice for all the services handled either by Murray Lampert and/or any other outside contractors and vendors. The entire process will be completely transparent, so you can be sure that no corners will be cut and that everything we do is completely legal. You can rest assured that the kitchen we rebuild will last as we offer a five year written warranty to all our esteemed customers!
