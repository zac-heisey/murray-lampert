> "We recently completed a project with Murray Lampert. Two load bearing walls were removed to make way for an open concept first floor and the kitchen was relocated to the opposite side of our home. From the start we were impressed with the integrity & professionalism of each of the ML team members we worked with. We were invited to their office to meet everyone and spent a good amount of time with Gregg Cantor, who walked us through the “ML way”. Gregg remained accessible and engaged throughout the project and spoke with pride about the long family history of their company and their effort to grow happy clients...These guys are pros. Thank you ML!" - _LAURA GHOSN – MAY 05, 2017_

> "I hired Murray Lampert to do a major remodel of our home in 2008. Given our home was built in 1932, it was a very difficult and ML did a great job in rolling with the punches that the old house continually threw at them. Fast forward to today, we discovered some in-wall damage that had been caused by the way the roof was finished during the remodel. Although the job was well out of ML's warranty period, they stepped up and split the cost of the repairs with us. If dealing with a contractor that is reputable and willing to stand by their work is important to you, then you should consider Murray Lampert." - _MATTHEW SCHRADY - NOV 07, 2016_

> "I was very hesitant when my wife asked me about a kitchen remodel. I got referrals from friends and neighbors, then called a couple companies I saw advertising the best deals. Murray Lampert was NOT the best price, but was, by far, the best VALUE!! Reputable, honest and reliable. Few businesses these days do what they say and stand by their word. Murray Lampert is a throwback company that prides itself on customer satisfaction and doing business the right way. I highly recommend them for any home improvement project!!" - _DON PURSLEY - JUN 09, 2016_

> "The company really pulled through for us on this project to improve our home's efficiency. We got a new AC condenser, a new heater(which was relocated to a different part of the house to so that we could expand the closet next to the old heater), new rain gutters, and a new Solar system on our roof. Everyone we worked with were nice and helpful. It feels good to get credits from SDG&E because of our new source of Solar Power." - _DAVID ZABLOW - SEP 23, 2016_

> "Can not say enough about our Murray Lampert experience. We had a very tight time frame and strict budget. Murray Lampert made both a priority. They finished on time, on budget and everything looks wonderful. The staff and construction workers were all friendly, communicative, and professional. Will use them again if we have any additional remodeling needs." - _ELIZABETH CHENNAMCHETTY - AUG 08, 2015_
