<h1 class="mainhead">San Diego Custom Cabinets</h1>
Are your old cabinets breaking down, deteriorating, or are they simply just out dated? At Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel, our <strong>San Diego custom cabinetry service</strong> can help you get high quality cabinetry at affordable prices.

<strong>As custom cabinet makers in <a href="http://murraylampert.com/">San Diego</a></strong>, our goal is to <a href="/san-diego-design-build-contractors/">design and build</a> a project to meet your needs and budget. Starting with an in home consultation, we listen to your needs, enter into a design agreement, and create a space plan that fits your budget. We then assist with selecting cabinets, granite, stone, plumbing fixtures, appliances etc. Unlike most cabinet contractors, Murray Lampert is a full service home remodeler <a href="/affiliation/">licensed</a> to handle all aspects of home remodeling.

Our <a href="/san-diego-design-build-contractors/">Design/Build</a> system streamlines the home remodeling process, is more cost effective, and very efficient.  After the design phase, we obtain all the necessary permits and our cabinetry builders begin fabrication. Prior to starting cabinet construction, we create final shop drawings for your approval to make certain all your needs are met.

Each remodeling job we undertake is assigned a project manager to ensure high quality work is completed on time and within budget.
