What is the definition of Green Building?

</div>
A sustainable building, or green building is an outcome of a design philosophy which focuses on increasing the efficiency of resource use — energy, water and materials — while reducing building impacts on human health and the environment during the building's lifecycle, through better siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and removal. Though green building is interpreted in many different ways, a common view is that they should be designed and operated to reduce <a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></a>overall impact of the built environment on human health and the environment by:

<strong>Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources</strong>
<strong>Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity</strong>
<strong>Reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation</strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_building#cite_note-1"></a>For more information on Green Building, visit <a href="http://www.builditgreen.org/">http://www.builditgreen.org/</a> or call Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel at (619) 285-9222.
