Holiday preparations tend to leave many homeowners exhausted and glad the season is finally over. Many choose to visit expensive spas or go away during the weekend to relax and enjoy. But what if you could bring the spa experience to your home?

Steam showers are going to be a huge trend in 2017 and part of almost every bathroom remodel in San Diego. Their function is two-fold: they provide a fantastic stress-relief and bring luxury to your bathroom. A steam shower is something you are going to enjoy for years to come and not just a passing trend or a whim. Having such a powerful stress-relief in your own home can make your every single day better.

In this article, the experts at Murray Lampert, the <a href="http://murraylampert.com/murray-lampert-recognized-among-north-americas-best">leading general contractor</a> in San Diego CA, are going to explain what the steam shower is, how it works, and lay out some of its benefits.
<h2>What Are Steam Showers?</h2>
Steam showers are enclosed showers permeated by clouds of steam. They isolate moisture inside of the construction and can be used before, after or during the regular showers. They resemble a classic walk-in shower.

However, steam showers have a digital panel that allows the user to control the steam inside. Most steam showers are also equipped with atmospheric LED lighting, a music player and an individual pump for essential oils for a full aromatherapy experience. Steam showers stalls are usually around 160 cubic feet in volume.

<h2>How Do They Work?</h2>
Steam showers rely on a steam generator that boils cold water and supplies the steam into the stall. Contrary to popular opinion, steam showers are very economical when it comes to water consumption as they only use two gallons of water for a 20-minute steam bath. Even with the running water on, the steam shower uses no more than 50 gallons of water.

However, donâ€™t be surprised if your electric bill goes up as heating the water to boiling point does not come free. A standard-size steam shower is powered by a 7-killowatt generator.
<h2>Can a Steam Shower Benefit my Health?</h2>
A steam bath has many health benefits. It is a proven relaxation method people have been using for centuries. Steam showers are good for deep cleansing of the skin as well as flushing out toxins from our organism. Steam can also help improve your metabolism, and relax your muscles and mind.

Steam showers are also great for people suffering from allergies or arthritis, and are known to benefit your immune system. Finally, steam showers can help people of all ages suffering from <a href="http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/">high blood pressure</a> and chronic pains.
<h2>Installing a Steam Shower</h2>
Getting one of these inside your bathroom is no DIY project and will require the help of a <a href="http://murraylampert.com/find-the-best-general-contractor-san-diego">professional general contractor</a>. A good designer will have to overcome a few challenges such as finding a place to hide the generator but still keep it close enough to the shower. The generators are usually hidden inside a walk-in closet, out of sight but close enough to be able to function properly. After this issue is resolved, the contractor will install the tiles and the shower walls. A plumber and an electrician will finalize the construction, connecting the pipework and powering the generator.
