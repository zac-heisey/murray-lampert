Earlier this month, [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/) celebrated our 43rd anniversary. Since 1975, our team has proudly served homeowners throughout San Diego, providing concierge service, high quality work, and the best warranty in the business.

We hold our customer service and design awards in high regard. But it's our [client reviews](/reviews) and [testimonials](/testimonials), as well as our reputation among our industry peers, and the San Diego community, that truly makes my team and I proud. To us, reputation and respect are far more important than national rankings or industry awards.

We have many repeat clients and we've built relationships that have continued well after our construction or remodeling projects have been completed. We also have many examples of home improvement clients whose businesses we ourselves have patronized, including IT, insurance, and mortgage services. This speaks volumes about our culture and community-centric approach to business we've cultivated over 4 family generations at Murray Lampert.

Rather than building a self-serving, limiting, and expensive showroom with a huge staff, we utilize design centers all over San Diego to offer an even broader selection than a single contractor location. We also arrange wholesale direct pricing for plumbing fixtures, appliances, flooring, outdoor living, and landscaping. Most of our competitors include profit and overhead on every project they bid on. At Murray Lampert, we deliver the same fixtures, brands, and designs you'll find at other contractorâ€™s showrooms, without the high pressure or inflated prices.

Since becoming President & CEO of Murray Lampert in 1990, I've made it my mission to build a [tight-knit, well-respected team](/about-murray-lampert-design-build-remodel#team-members) of remodeling professionals to help us build upon the strong relationships we've established with craftsmen, vendors, and the larger San Diego community. With my wife, Lisa, and daughter, Rachel, playing critical roles in the company, we truly are a family business that places relationships at the forefront of everything we do.

Here's to another amazing 43 years!
