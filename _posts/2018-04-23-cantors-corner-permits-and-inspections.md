Too often, unsuspecting homeowners are taken advantage by disreputable home contractors who convince them that permits and inspections aren't necessary. On the contrary, pulling home permits and having proper building inspections carried out help to ensure your safety, as well as protect your renovation investment.

<h2>What  are San Diego Building Permits?</h2>
Building permits are merely measures put in  place to ensure the safety of residents. These permits are able to regulate  construction, and make certain that homes and buildings will not cause harm to  the residents. Due to the differences in climate and geography across the  country, state and local governments are responsible for establishing the  appropriate codes and guidelines for any construction project.  Some areas also enforce certain laws and  permits in reference to energy conservation requirements.

After getting permits from the city, there  are a number of procedures that must be followed. You may have to submit plans  to the city that outline your construction and you will have to establish  details regarding the type of construction.
<h2>What kinds of construction need a permit?</h2>
Most types of construction need some type of  permit. All new construction requires a number of permits, and any remodeling  or renovation projects that modify electrical, mechanical, structural, or  plumbing of the house also require permits. From structural preparation for  earthquakes, to protection against electrical fires, these changes should be  made by <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/about/">home remodeling professionals</a>, and do require permits.
<h2>How do I obtain a permit?</h2>
Some types of permits are considered over the  counter, which means that you can obtain it in one trip. Others require you to  submit plans and applications and then return to receive a permit. You can get  a permit at the city’s <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/contact/servmap1.shtml">Development  Review Center</a>, which is located in downtown San Diego.  If you are making small changes to your home  that still require a permit, you can visit the city’s <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/contact/servmap2.shtml">Inspection  Services Office</a> for rapid processing.
<h2>What is zoning?</h2>
Depending on the location of your home or new  construction, zoning regulations may be addressed. <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/zoning/zoning.shtml">City Council has approved  maps</a> stating how many residences or specific types of buildings are allowed in  any given area. Different types of <a href="http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/dplu/zoning/index.html">zoning regulations</a> determine how large the  houses are allowed to be in a certain area, or how many residences can be built  there. If you want to build something that is not allowed in a specific zone,  you may apply to the city council for an exception.

In San Diego there are <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/overview/">planned districts</a> that  show the intention of the property in that area. Some projects may be long-term  plants, so it is essential that you check zoning regulations and procedures  before having your heart set on a certain home or addition.
<h2>What are the inspections?</h2>
Property owners are responsible for having  inspections throughout the course of the building process. The type of  construction will designate the inspections that are required. Most permits  expire after 180 days if you have not scheduled inspections during that time.  Your project will be considered in violation of city codes if your construction  is completed without proper inspections within the time frame given. If this  happens, you are able to apply for a permit extension and reactivation.

In this edition of Cantor's Corner, I outline some of the primary reasons why homeowners should _always_ secure the necessary permits and inspections to guarantee they're in-line with local building department codes, rules, and regulations.
