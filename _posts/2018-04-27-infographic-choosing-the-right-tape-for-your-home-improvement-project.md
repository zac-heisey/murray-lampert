## Choosing the Right Tape for Your Home Improvement Project

#### Electrical Tape

Also known as "insulating tape," electrical tape is made of plastic (most commonly vinyl) and is used to insulate electrical wires. It comes in a variety of colors to indicate voltage. Electrical tape is also great for labeling, grip enhancement, and cable installation.

#### Duct Tape

Duct tape is considered the most versatile type of tape, and is a staple of many homeowners for an array of DIY projects. Modern duct tape is made with woven fabrics to provide strength & flexibility. It can be used just about anywhere heavy-duty adhesion is needed, although it is susceptible to high heat and leaves a residue when removed.

#### Foil/Metal Tape

If you're tackling an HVAC job at home, aluminum foil tape should be your go-to. Foil tape is flame resistant, holds up in extreme temperatures, and sticks strong in high humidity. If you'd rather not mess with duct mastic to seal up your HVAC system, aluminum foil tape is a solid alternative.

#### Masking (Painter's) Tape

Masking, or painter's tape, is a paper-based, multi-use tape that is primarily used to mask off areas during interior and exterior painting projects. Key characteristics include easy tearing and low-grade adhesive to reduces damage and residue on surfaces once the tape is removed.

#### Carpet Tape

As the name suggests, carpet tape is mainly used to tack down carpets and keep area rugs in place. Carpet tape is flexible, durable, moisture-resistant, and usually featured adhesive on both sides. One-sided carpet tape is used primarily to join two smaller pieces to form a large section of carpeting.

#### Packing Tape

According to [Can-Do National Tape](https://www.can-dotape.com/product-category/products/packaging-tapes/), there are actually four distinct varieties of packing tape: carton sealing tapes, printed tapes, gummed tapes, and label protection tapes. Each of these varieties is meant to work with certain package weights, sizes, and shipping methods. Most homeowners will be just fine using the clear plastic packing tape most of us are familiar with - also known as “Polypropylene Tape.” It’s strong, durable, and resistant to tearing or breaking during shipment.

#### Mounting Tape

Renters are probably the most familiar with mounting tape, which is a double-sided tape used to hang, mount, or display things on interior walls without causing any damage. Mounting tapes are usually foam-based, and they vary in size and by the amount of weight they are able to support and secure to a surface.
