What is the difference between true European cabinets and traditional American face frame style?  With European cabinets, the doors/drawer fronts are flush fully overlayed and there are no frames or styles. Here is an example:

The advantage of European cabinets is you get more usable space by having open insides without frames or styles.  Not only does this make the openings bigger, the volume of space inside is greater.

European style cabinets can be wood, laminate or thermo wrapped.  The choices of doors, wood species and cabinet accessories are unlimited.
