During a home remodel or renovation is the perfect time to add some smart technology to your home. There are so many benefits to using smart home technology, it's no wonder why [sales of home automation products](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2017/us-home-automation-sales-growth-fueled-in-part-by-voice-control-and-digital-assistants/) are way up.

A huge benefit to many home automation installations is that they don't require major updates to implement. With most [smart home technology](/get-the-best-technology-stack-for-your-home-in-5-minutes/) being wireless, you won't have to tear up your walls to install them. Making your home into a smart home will even increase the value of your house. People want to buy a home with all of the conveniences that home automation has to offer. 

### These Products Make Your Life Easier

#### Smart Outlets

Smart outlets allow you to control appliances, scheduling them to turn on and off at certain times. This will save you a lot of money. You can program a heater or air unit to run only when you want, turn off lights at a certain hour, even have your coffee maker wake up and brew a fresh pot just before you get home. 

#### Smart Thermostats

A smart thermostat will do the same thing for your heat and cooling needs. They are smart enough to learn your routine and go off only when you need them to. It is better to get a smart thermostat and use your smart outlets for other jobs, although a smart outlet can help make older AC units and heaters smart.

#### Leak Detectors

When your hot water heater bursts it can be a costly mess, destroying a large area of your home. However, these days you can be alerted instantly. This means that you can shut off the water source and save yourself a lot of mess and money.

### These Products Make Your homeowners Safer

#### Video Doorbells

It's dangerous to open the door to strangers. A video doorbell lets you see who is there on your smartphone, whether you are home or not. You can even have a conversation with the visitor.

#### Smart Locks

Your old door lock is nothing compared to the home security that a smart lock provides. A smart lock allows you to lock and unlock the door from anywhere. If you are away and a friend is watering the plants, you can give them a passcode that lasts for a certain duration and lock the door behind them. You can also give family members codes that let only them in.

#### A Full-Fledged Security System

You need a security system. The [best home security system](http://www.gadgetreview.com/best-home-security-system) that you can buy. It not only protects your family but gives you valuable peace of mind. A security system can notify you about a number of emergencies. Glass break sensors will cause an alarm if a burglar breaks a window. Motion sensors will detect intruders, and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors can save your life as well.

#### Smart Garage Door Opener

We keep a lot of valuables in our garages, but the problem is that our family members may leave the door open and that just invites theft. Use a smart garage door opener to be able to open and close your garage no matter where you are.

These are just a few of the benefits of Home Automation and it's easy to see why you should outfit your house with this technology. When you are already doing a home renovation, it's a perfect time. You may as well get everything completed at once and then you can sit back and reap all of the awards when it is finished.
