<p style="text-align: center;">There have been many recent articles predicting that 2011 will be a big year for San Diego Kitchen and Bath remodeling.  Here are some recommendations to help you start the process:</p>
1.  Take into consideration how long you plan to stay in your home and establish a budget.  If you anticipate moving in less than 5 years, your budget should be more modest, choosing conservative finishes and mid range fixtures.  Otherwise, it is worth spending more for your own long term enjoyment.

2.  Go to model homes and open houses to get ideas.  Take photos and make note of cabinet types, counters materials, tile or stone you like.

3.  Visit your local plumbing and appliance showroom where you can see working kitchens and baths with the latest products.

4.  Create a wish list of what features or changes would make your kitchen and/or bath more functional.

Once you have done your homework, it's time to interview contractors.  A design/build general contractor will handle the conceptual plans and provide a accurate quote with finish and fixture allowances.
