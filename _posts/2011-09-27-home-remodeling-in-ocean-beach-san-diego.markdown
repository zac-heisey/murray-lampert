Just seven miles from Downtown San Diego, Ocean Beach is a quaint neighborhood, bordered by the San Diego River to the north, the Pacific Ocean on the west, and local streets on the east and south. Interpretations of neighborhood lines tend to vary from resident to resident. Flourishing business and development over the years has led to the laid-back, tight-knit community of Ocean Beach today.

<strong>Neighborhood Facts</strong>

•    Ocean Beach was founded in 1887 by Billy Carlson and Frank Higgins; however, in 1890, the real estate bust led to a halt in development.
•    David Collier, a resident, helped to promote and popularize the neighborhood, eventually bringing in electricity, paved streets, and a street car line by 1913.
•    Today, Ocean Beach takes up 742 acres of land.
•    The 2000 census showed OB to have nearly 14,000 residents.
•    The media housing value is estimated to be around $270,000, with a median household income of around $37,000.
•    OB is home to three schools: Ocean Beach Elementary School, Sacred Heart Academy, and Warren Walker.

The homes in Ocean Beach have the typical architecture and design of a beach community. Homes in the area have generally not been updated but retain a vintage charm that matches perfectly with the laidback, hometown atmosphere. Because of the age of the homes and their exposure to salty air, residents opt for <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/remodel/">home remodels</a> in order to reinforce durability of housing structures. To modernize and increase resale value of homes, <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services/">kitchen remodels</a>, <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-bathroom-remodeling-services/">bathroom remodels</a>, and <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-room-additions/">room additions</a> are popular projects. As you travel south on Sunset Cliffs Boulevard, you can admire a breathtaking view of the Pacific Ocean to the right, and the beautifully constructed, high-end design of the ocean-front homes to the left.
