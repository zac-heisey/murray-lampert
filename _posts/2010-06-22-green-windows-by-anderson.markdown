Recently I had the privilege of visiting the Andersen Door and Window plant in Minnesota.  Not only was I impressed with the pride in workmanship that was evident, and the spotless state of the art facility,  but the fact that less then 1% of the construction waste goes into landfills makes me feel good about selling Andersen products.

The employees of Andersen take pride in their workmanship, and are very loyal to a company that really takes great care of their people.  In the Window and Door plant, Andersen employs over 2,500 men and women with an average tenure of 21 years.   That speaks volumes about the Andersen tradition.

Andersen Company manufactures several different lines starting with the entry level 100 Series, a true Green product.  The main frame is made of all recycled wood and vinyl materials.  Not only Green, the 100 Series is structuraly strong, straight and stable in hot and cold conditions.  The quality, colors, features, special shapes and price point, make Andersen 100 a great alternative to conventional vinyl.

On the top end of the Andersen line is the Architects Series.  Packed with custom features like a tilt down sash, various hardware options, wood species, glass packages and shapes, the Architect Series fits well on custom homes or high end remodeling projects. 

After touring the plant, my confidence and appreciation of the Andersen quality makes offering their products to our clients easy.
