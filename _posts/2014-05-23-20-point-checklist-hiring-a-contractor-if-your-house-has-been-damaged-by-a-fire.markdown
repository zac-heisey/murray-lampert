The recent wildfires in San Diego caused damage to over 55 properties, costing the county millions of dollars. As devastating as the fires were, the community has remained steadfast and hopeful, and we’re here to do our part. For those who lost their homes and businesses in the fires, we've put together a quick checklist to help you find a reliable contractor to begin the rebuilding process. <img class="alignright" alt="20-Point Checklist: Hiring A Contractor If Your House Has Been Damaged By A Fire" src="http://www.murraylampert.com/wp-content/gallery/under-construction/Leung.jpg" width="392" height="220" />
<ol>
	<li>Hire a local contractor. The San Diego BIA (Building Industry Association) is an excellent source for referrals. The BIA can be reached at (858) 450-1221.</li>
	<li>Confirm that your contractor is licensed, bonded, &amp; fully insured including worker’s compensation.</li>
	<li>Request a certificate naming you as additional insured. Make sure your contractor has the proper coverage.</li>
	<li>Request proof of worker’s comp insurance. Every worker that steps foot on your property should have coverage.</li>
	<li>Ask for current and past references. Call the contractor’s references and ask questions. Go see their work.</li>
	<li>Google the name/names of the companies you are considering and look at their reviews.</li>
	<li>Check the Better Business Bureau reliability report. <a href="http://www.sd.bbb.org/">www.sd.bbb.org</a></li>
	<li>Check the Contractor’s State License Board website to make certain the contractor is citation free and in good standing. <a href="http://www.cslb.ca.gov/">www.cslb.ca.gov</a></li>
	<li>Do not be rushed into signing a contract without reading and fully understanding the details.</li>
	<li>Make sure that you get an all-inclusive fixed price for your construction.</li>
	<li>Trust your instincts. You are entering into a long term relationship so make sure it feels right.</li>
	<li>Require that everything is in writing.  Make sure there is a clear scope detailing what is included and excluded.</li>
	<li>Review your building plans thoroughly before signing off.  You may want to consult with someone that is familiar with reading blueprints if you have any questions.</li>
	<li>If allowances are called for fixtures and finishes, go shopping to make sure the budgets fit your taste.</li>
	<li>Require a written timeline in working days.</li>
	<li>Require a bond, escrow account or a private bank inspector.</li>
	<li>Get lien releases from all subcontractors and suppliers with every payment you make.</li>
	<li>Do not give any money down or make any payments until services are provided.</li>
	<li>Hold a retention until final inspection is approved, your final punch list is completed and you get a completion certificate from your contractor.</li>
	<li>Make sure you get a written warranty.</li>
