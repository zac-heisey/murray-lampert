<strong><a href="http://www.sd.bbb.org">Expert knowledge.</a></strong> Customers turn to their contractor for guidance, experience and knowledge.  Another words, a home remodeler should get the big pictues.  All the ins and outs of custom home remodeling including trends, products, code requirements and best practices.

<strong><a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-design-build-contractors/">Up-front pricing.</a></strong><strong> </strong> Homeowners want to know how much your the entire remodeling package will cost up front before you start.  The only way to feel confident the remodeling firm is providing an accurate quote is with a preliminary plan and you shouldn't  have to pay design fees to find out.
