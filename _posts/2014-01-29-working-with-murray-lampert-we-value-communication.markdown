There are so many ways to communicate: land lines, cell phones, fax machines, emails, text messaging, video conferencing, and more. And between spoken, written, and electronic communication, each has its place.

<strong>Rethinking What Face Time Means</strong>

Communication is vital to every home remodeling and construction project. Since the early 80s when I started supervising projects, the means of communication have drastically changed as technology has advanced.

There was a time I had to rely on a voice pager and then find a payphone when a client needed to reach me. Of course, technology now is more efficient. But make no mistake—a live phone conversation or face-to-face meeting is still the best way to communicate. Without body language and vocal inflection, it is too easy to be misunderstood.

<strong>How We Communicate<a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/communicate.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-1984 alignright" alt="Home Remodeling Communication" src="http://www.murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/communicate.jpeg" width="300" height="197" /></a></strong>

While phone or face-to-face conversations are our favorite means of communicating, we understand that it’s not always possible and strive to communicate as clearly as we can regardless of the method.

On a typical home remodeling or home construction project, we communicate 5 to 6 different ways. There are many in-person meetings after the initial consultation, including design development, finalizing the contract documents, and going over pre-construction procedures. Sometimes we even use video conferencing to conduct meetings if all the parties are unable to meet in one place.

During the course of our work, there is communication in some form on a daily basis to keep our clients in the know every step of the way. We use email and other electronic messaging to communicate faster and more efficiently for these daily updates.

<strong>The Art of Understanding</strong>

We are born with two ears and one mouth for a reason. Communication is what has made<a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/about/"> our company successful for four decades</a>. Our goal is to provide the best service possible. Technology will never replace live communication—it can only enhance it!
