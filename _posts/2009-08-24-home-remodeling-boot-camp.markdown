Overview

I am Gregg Cantor, owner of Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel in San Diego. My company has been designing, contracting and building residential remodeling projects since 1975. I am a third generation home remodeler. My career started in 1978 when I began handling construction clean up on job sites for my Grandfather Murray Lampert. Now, over 31 year later, I am Owner and President of Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel.

The purpose of my blog is to educate consumers on the home remodeling process from initial contractor interviews to when the keys are turned over to you at completion. With my experience and guidance your remodeling project will be enjoyable and rewarding.

I am happy to answer any direct questions by email, <a href="mailto:gcantor@murraylampert.com">gcantor@murraylampert.com</a>.
