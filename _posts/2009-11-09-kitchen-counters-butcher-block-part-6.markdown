Wood countertops offer variety and functionality. Hardwoods such as maple and oak are most often used as countertop woods.  Most frequently used for islands or an inlayed work areas.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
Easy to clean and a smooth work surface for baking.  Can be sanded and resealed as needed.

<strong>Cons:</strong>
Can be damaged by water and stains over time.  Scratches must be oiled or sealed according to manufacturer's specifications.

<strong>Summary:</strong>
A good option for islands when used in conjuction with other materials like granite.  Due to the maintenance required, not a good idea for an entire kitchen.
