Before starting a home remodeling project, it's important to understand the different types of project delivery methods that are used by contractors and remodeling firms to execute construction projects. The three primary methods used in residential building and home improvement projects are:

- Design-Build (DB)
- Design-Bid-Build (DBB)
- Multi-Prime (MP)

Each project delivery method has pros and cons, but we specialize in and prefer the design-build process for a variety of reasons:

- It provides a single point of contact for the customer, eliminating the "middle man" role for homeowners.
- Estimates are more accurate, costs are better controlled, and there are fewer under-budgeting issues.
- Each phase of a project is completed in a timely manner.
- There's accountability and consistency throughout the project.

To further illustrate what makes design-build such a great process for executing [San Diego home remodeling](/san-diego-home-remodel-services) projects, we've put together a visual guide to the design-build process below.

## A Visual Guide to the Design-Build Process

#### Steps in the Design-Build Process

**Design**  
Every design-build project begins with an in-depth design discussion, where your design-build contractor will work with you to develop your ideas into blueprints, architectural designs, and other visual mock-ups.

**Pre-Construction**  
Before breaking ground on your approved design, your design-build contractor will work with you to finalize details such as colors, materials, finishes, fixtures, and more. Timelines will be laid out, trades coordinated, and financing will be secured.

**Construction**  
Now the fun begins! As work on your project progresses, you can expect regular communication and updates from your dedicated design-build project manager. Because design and construction are handled by a single entity in the design-build process, your can expect rapid, aggressive project progress, with consistent communicate along the way.

**Post-Construction**  
Once your project is finished, your design-build contractor will conduct a thorough walkthrough with you, pointing out important details, taking your feedback, and making sure that nothing has been left out. Reputable design-build firms will have protections and warranties in place to keep homeowners covered for several years following completion.

#### The Benefits of Design-Build

- A [design-build firm](/san-diego-design-build-contractors) offers a single point of contact for the homeowner with everything in one package.

- The design-build firm is responsible for both the architectural/design aspects of the project, as well as the engineering/construction work.

- Some of the biggest benefits of design-build include rapid delivery, a smooth process, better solutions and better communication.

- Cost overruns, time delays, and miscommunication issues are extremely common in traditional project delivery arrangements with homeowners acting as middlemen. Design-build projects avoid many of these issues.

- In traditional project delivery, designer and contractor can easily blame one another for cost overruns and other problems. Not so in design-build projects.

- By choosing a design-build approach, you could save a lot of time, money, and stress on your next project.
