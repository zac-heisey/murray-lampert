Kitchen remodels are one of the most popular and cost-effective places to invest your home remodeling dollar. For one, a remodeled kitchen is a major boon to your home’s value and curb appeal. It’s the home project with the greatest return-on-investment when the time comes to sell your home.

Yet, for many homeowners, the upfront costs can be daunting. According to data from HomeAdvisor, the average kitchen renovation costs homeowners over $22,000. Remodeling just this one space of your home can quickly add up.

Here’s the good news: it is possible to spend less while still getting more out of your remodeling dollar. In this article, we review some of the ways homeowners can both save money and get an awesome [kitchen remodel in San Diego](/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services).

## Save On Demolition

An experienced remodeling contractor is fully capable of building your dream kitchen. For many homeowners, that vision now includes taking down walls, installing islands, or extending the kitchen. All of that is fine! Opening up the kitchen can increase its appeal, value, and—most importantly—livability for you and your family. If an open kitchen concept is core to what you want out of the space, talk to your contractor about what’s possible.

However, for homeowners on a tight budget, it’s not always as necessary as TV home remodelers make it sound. In fact, it is completely possible to transform a kitchen _without_ any demolition work or a major re-imagining of the space. This is where working with a [reputable home remodeling contractor](/awards-affiliations) is key, as they will be able to advise you on whether a complete tear-down of your existing kitchen is necessary.

## Invest In Quality, Save On Extras

There are a few places where compromising quality can really come back to bite you. Investing in good, [high-quality countertops and cabinets](https://www.superiorstoneandcabinet.com/) is always a good idea. Go for quartz or granite over other less expensive options or imitations, and invest in cabinets that are built to last. Most importantly, have a licensed contractor handle the install. The average homeowner spends about half their kitchen remodeling budget on these two aspects of the project for a reason: they have a major impact on your home’s value.

## Don’t Neglect the Simple Things

Counters, cabinets, and appliances matter, but so do small, relatively inexpensive details. High-quality knobs and fixtures for cabinets are a great way to add personality to your new kitchen without spending a ton of money. The right lighting fixtures allow the entire space to shine. And it doesn’t get much more affordable than a fresh coat of paint.

## Hire the Right Team

There’s no substitute for hiring the right people to handle your kitchen remodel. In this business, that means experienced, licensed [remodeling professionals with a proven track record of high-quality work](/testimonials). Try to cut corners here, and you could end up feeling the negative effects down the road when you encounter issues with installation, permitting, or resale.
