If you took it easy this summer season and have an itch to be productive before the cold temperatures keep you inside this winter season, know that focusing on home improvement could help you scratch your productive itch. Here at [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/), we’ve got plenty of projects to keep you busy and help bring out the best in your home. 

## Gutters

Your gutters are essential to protecting your home’s interior as well as its foundation by draining rainwater away from your property. But to do that, your gutters have to be cleared out. Climb up to your roof and clear your gutters to keep them flowing. It’s also a good idea to invest in quality gutter guards to keep fall leaves and other types of debris from clogging up your gutters and triggering water damage. While you’re at it, be sure to give your downspouts some TLC as well. 

## Attic Insulation 

Keep your property nice and warm and your energy bills low by [insulating](/natural-wool-or-recycled-cotton-which-insulation-is-better-for-your-home/) your attic as part of your fall home improvement projects list. That insulation will help to keep warm and cool air pumped out from your HVAC unit from escaping. Leaks cause your air conditioner and furnace to work harder than necessary to sustain your desired temperature, which leads to overspending.

## Check Your Roof

You depend on your roof to protect everything that’s underneath it, making it essential that your roof is always in the best shape possible. While checking your gutters, inspect your roof to see if there are any missing or damaged shingles or other issues that may require professional help. Additionally, the flashing around your gutters, skylights, pipes and chimneys should receive a once-over as well. 

## Take a Peek at Your Windows and Doors 

Have you been feeling a draft in your house? If so, it could be that you have outside air trickling in from your windows and doors. Just like poor attic insulation, gaps around your windows and doors can lead to HVAC leaks and overspending. Quality weather-stripping and caulking can take care of those drafts, and you may be able to take care of the job on your own. 

That being said, it’s possible that you may be better off replacing your windows and doors if they’re too old to function properly. Newer doors and windows are designed to be more energy efficient, and they can provide you with better peace of mind knowing they do a better job of keeping you and your family secure. 

## Clear Out the Garage 

Because you may be storing your lawn mower, water hose and other yard equipment commonly used during the summer, see that you have enough [room in your garage](/10-things-you-should-consider-when-converting-your-garage/). The fall season is the perfect time to go through everything in your garage to see what you want to keep, throw away or sell for a bit of holiday cash. Implementing a storage system is also a great idea to make it easy for you to find whatever you need whenever you need it. While you’re in the garage, gather up winter equipment and ensure everything is in good working order for the winter. 

## Clear Your Exterior Water Pipes 

The last thing you want to deal with during the winter is a burst pipe. Once you’ve watered your lawn and washed your car for the last time this season, detach, drain and store your hoses, and drain your exterior water pipes as well. Simply run the water until the pipes run dry before shutting off the valves to the exterior hose bibs. That way, you don’t have to worry about water freezing in the pipes. To help prevent burst pipes inside and outside your home, wrap them all in heating tape. 

## Check Up on Your Furnace 

The best time to take care of your furnace is before you need to use it. Have an HVAC professional take a look at your furnace to see that it’s ready for the winter, and be sure that your furnace filters are clean as can be. Dirty, clogged filters don’t perform as well, and they can blow allergens and irritants through your vents.
