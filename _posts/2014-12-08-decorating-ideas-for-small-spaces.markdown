If you’re feeling a little cramped, sometimes all it takes is a little bit of <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/remodel/" target="_blank">remodeling </a>and some <em>feng shui</em> to open your space. Here we’ll take a look at ways you can make the most out of your small space with storage tips, visual tricks, and more.

<h2>Small Spaces Crave Smart Storage</h2>
Opt for furniture that has hidden storage (such as a hollow ottoman or under-the-bed storage bins). Use walls whenever possible to keep items off of the floor. When purchasing furniture, opt for tall pieces that illuminate the height of the room and also take up less floor space.
<h2>Open up Your Space with Paint</h2>
Dark colors can make spaces look much smaller than they are. If you’re dealing with a space that’s already a bit tight, use lighter colors to get the most out of each nook and cranny. If you have crown molding, paint the molding the same color as the ceiling to create the illusion that the room is wider than it is.

<h2>Think Big with Tile</h2>
Contrary to instinct, larger tiles can actually make a small room appear larger. For a narrow kitchen or <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-bathroom-remodeling-services/" target="_blank">bathroom</a>, elect for 24x24-inch tiles instead of the usual 12-inch tiles. Setting your tiles diagonally can also create the illusion of a larger space.
<h2>Make Use of Mirrors</h2>
Mirrors are a small space’s best friend. The bigger the better—and if you can place two facing each other, you’ll get double the aura of depth to your room. Mirrors don’t have to be a boring addition, either. Experiment with paneling mirrors, placing them on the backs of doors that are often open, or adding a standing mirror to the corner of a room.
<h2>Keep It Simple</h2>
Try to avoid ornate structure and frills that bog down the visual path. Opt for cleaner <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-custom-cabinet-construction-services/" target="_blank">cabinet faces</a>, and clear off any flat surfaces. Store garbage cans under countertops and keep as many things off the floor as possible. Even something as simple as opting for furniture that has legs can do wonders for maximizing a small amount of floor space. <strong> </strong>
<h2>Leverage Layout and Lighting</h2>
Sometimes the layout of a room just isn’t as efficient as it could be. Take a look at the floor plan and see where items might be able to be moved or remodeled to take better advantage of the space at hand.  Opt for recessed lighting to de-clutter the ceiling, and choose focused lighting to bring brightness to otherwise dark corners.

Living in a small space doesn’t mean you have to be a complete minimalist or be buried under clutter. With some creative problem solving, and maybe some help from a <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com" target="_blank">professional remodeler</a>, you will find all the space you need in your nest.
