The <a title="San Diego Better Business Bureau" href="http://www.sd.bbb.org" target="_blank">BBB Torch Award For Marketplace Ethics</a> is presented to businesses who demonstrate the highest level of integrity in the community.  On December 2nd, 2014, the 17th annual <a title="BBB" href="http://www.bbb.org" target="_blank">Better Business Bureau Awards</a> were held at the Town &amp; Country Convention Center in San Diego, California.  We are proud and honored to be the first place winner in our category. This is our 4th award - we have previous awards from 2007, 2008, 2010 - and everyone on the <a href="/team-members/">Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel team</a> played a role in helping us achieve another great milestone.

Next year, our 4 generation architectural design and home remodeling firm will celebrate our 40th anniversary.  No matter what economic condition San Diego has been in, we have always maintained our core values of honesty, integrity, quality and value.
