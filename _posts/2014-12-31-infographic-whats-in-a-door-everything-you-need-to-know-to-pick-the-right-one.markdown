<strong>Popular Types of Doors</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Panel doors: The most common type of door seen in homes today, often designed with a classic pattern of square panels.</li>
	<li>Sliding: Door slides along a track, saving space. Made of wood, glass, or lined with mirrors.</li>

<strong>Material Matters</strong>

What your door is made of is an important decision. Each material has its own unique characteristics.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Steel</strong>: Typically filled with high-density foam insulation with baked-on polyester finish, these doors can have a slick, modern look and feel.
<ul>
	<li><em>Pros</em>
<ul>
	<li>Lower maintenance</li>
	<li>Less expensive</li>
	<li>Energy efficient</li>

</ul>
</li>
	<li><em>Cons</em>
<ul>
	<li>Susceptible to rust</li>
	<li>Conducts temperature: hot or cold</li>
	<li>Dents easily</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Wood</strong>: With a wide variety of wood species, the choices of stains and paints are seemingly endless.
<ul>
	<li><em>Pros</em>
<ul>
	<li>Wide aesthetic options</li>
	<li>Scratches can easily be repaired</li>
</ul>
</li>

	<li>May fade, distort and warp over time</li>
	<li>Absorbs moisture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fiberglass</strong>: Mimicking the look and feel of wooden doors, fiberglass material requires virtually no maintenance and has 5x the insulation value of wood.
<ul>
	<li><em>Pros</em>
<ul>
	<li>Lowest maintenance</li>
	<li>Resistant to dents and scratches</li>

<strong>Open the Door of Possibilities: Some Tips</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Make an impact: The standard entry door is 3’ by 6’8”. Is your entrance larger? Consider a size upgrade for maximum impact.</li>
	<li>Understand colors: Wood stain can provide an elegant look, but choosing the color wisely will make a lasting impression on your home’s curb appeal. Consider your home’s overall color scheme, including any landscaping elements.</li>
	<li>Be mindful of your home’s style and personality: a modern home with bright colors may not mix well with a rustic, old-style door. Keep your options open, but take visual cues from the rest of your house to find the door that’s right for you.</li>
</ul>
