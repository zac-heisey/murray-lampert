<strong>Material Matters</strong>

<strong>Open the Door of Possibilities: Some Tips</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Make an impact: The standard entry door is 3’ by 6’8”. Is your entrance larger? Consider a size upgrade for maximum impact.</li>
	<li>Understand colors: Wood stain can provide an elegant look, but choosing the color wisely will make a lasting impression on your home’s curb appeal. Consider your home’s overall color scheme, including any landscaping elements.</li>
	<li>Be mindful of your home’s style and personality: a modern home with bright colors may not mix well with a rustic, old-style door. Keep your options open, but take visual cues from the rest of your house to find the door that’s right for you.</li>
</ul>
