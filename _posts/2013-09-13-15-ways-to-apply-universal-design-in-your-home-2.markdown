Selywn Goldsmith, the author of <em>Designing for the Disabled</em> (1963), pioneered free access for disabled people and is credited with the creation of the dropped curb (now a standard).

	<li>Equitable use</li>
	<li>Flexibility in use</li>
	<li>Simple and intuitive</li>
	<li>Perceptible information</li>
	<li>Tolerance for error</li>
	<li>Low physical effort</li>
	<li>Size and space for approach and use</li>
</ul>
