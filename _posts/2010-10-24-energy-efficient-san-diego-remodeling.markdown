<span style="font-size: 12.8601px;">As a quality contractor with over 27 years of home remodeling and construction experience, I believe in building better and tighter.  Not only to deliver more value and longer lasting homes, but also more comfortable and energy efficient San Diego Remodeling.</span>

Too many companies of all types are jumping on the “Green” bandwagon.   Often it is just marketing hype and a means to charge more with no real return other than some small tax credits.

The real savings are in tighter construction to reduce heat gain and cooling loss.

Constructing  a tighter more <a href="http://www.5min.com/Video/Energy-Efficient-Homes-107127451">energy efficient building</a> is not difficult and does not have to be expensive either.  Here are some of the options:
