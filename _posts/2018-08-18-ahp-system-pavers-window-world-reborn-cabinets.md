On this week's [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/approved-home-pros-on-radio-system-pavers-window-world-reborn-cabinets/) we discuss boosting curb appeal with [System Pavers](https://systempavers.com/), learn about SlimFrame windows with [Window World](https://www.windowworldsandiego.com/), and get invited to [Reborn Cabinet's](https://www.reborncabinets.com/) Customer Appreciation Day!

The latest Cantor's Corner dives into warranties and different elements of the customer experience during a home remodeling project. At [Murray Lampert](/), we always do our best to support our clients, have transparent communication, and maintain relationships long after a project is finished. With that in mind, it's important to ask your remodeling contractor about their warranty policy and how they service clients _after_ the sale.
