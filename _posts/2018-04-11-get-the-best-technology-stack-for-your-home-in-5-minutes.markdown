Just about anything can be “smart” today, including your home. There is a continuous explosion of new smart home technology that isn’t stopping anytime soon. You can get everything from security cameras that send your phone a notification when there’s a security risk to speakers you can control with your voice to play music throughout your house. 

You can equip your home with integrated automated systems to make your life more secure, convenient, and comfortable. By transforming your house into a [smart home](https://www.smarthome.com/), you can control lighting, security, multimedia systems, temperature, windows and doors, and appliances. Any house can become a smart home with the right tools, personalized recommendations, and a good Wi-Fi connection. 

### Figure Out What You Need

The first step to creating a smart home is determining what home technology products you need. You may feel intimidated by the plethora of products and possibilities on the market. That’s why you need to weed through all low-quality items out there that will only waste your time and money. Instead, you can easily find out exactly what you need with Casa Integration’s [recommendation tool](https://casaintegration.com/).

All you need to do is answer a few questions about your house and what technology you’re interested in. Then, Casa Integration will send you a recommendation of industry-leading products to get for your home. Once you receive your personalized recommendations, everything is a lot easier to figure out. 

### Consider What You Need

When you’re thinking about the features you’d like in your home, prioritize what will enhance your life overall. Do you entertain guests frequently or throw regular dinner parties? Are you the type to reach for the [latest high-tech gadgets in the kitchen](https://murraylampert.com/6-high-tech-gadgets-for-your-next-kitchen-remodel/), living room, or basement? Consider the most common 

Your home’s security is one aspect you should think about improving through smart technology. After all, why wouldn’t you want to feel more secure? Brands such as [Hikvision](http://www.hikvisionusa.com/ and [Dahua](http://www.dahuasecurity.com/?us) offer connected security cameras that will text you custom alerts when someone is detected near your home. Making your home smart means making your home safe. 

### Enhance Your Comfort

The next thing you should think about is what will make you more comfortable in your daily life. Smart technology such as an integrated thermostat will transform the way you control the temperature inside your home. What if you could maintain a consistent temperature while reducing energy costs? It’s possible with smart thermostats from brands such as [Ecobee](https://www.ecobee.com/) and [Nest](https://nest.com/). A smart thermostat can also turn off by itself when you leave and adjust itself according to your unique habits. 

### Make Life More Fun and Convenient

Of course, what’s a smart home without some flashy and exciting features? You can spruce up your home in a variety of ways. Here are some categories of smart products to consider:

- **Music**: Get some speakers with voice control to play your favorite tunes in any – or every – room.

- **Lighting**: Smart lighting systems can create gorgeous hues, wake you up gradually, or turn off and on at set times.

- **Television**: If you don’t have a smart TV yet, what are you waiting for? Your TV can handle movies, music, apps, and the internet. Some smart TVs even have voice interaction features, meaning you don’t have to worry if you lose the remote.

The possibilities of your smart home are endless. Don’t be afraid to splurge on some of these extras.

### Take Advantage of the Amazon Echo or Google Home

There’s nothing more convenient than voice activation devices, sometimes referred to as “[smart speakers](http://www.businessinsider.com/best-smart-speaker-amazon-echo)”. You can easily integrate your new smart home products with Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, or Apple’s Siri. When you connect all your home’s features to your preferred voice-activated product, you can control everything just by talking to one device. If you want everything in your home to be voice-controlled, this is your best bet. 

### Get It Installed

While you may be able to easily set up some of these products, doing all of it yourself may be a bit overwhelming. Luckily, you don’t have to do it all on your own. You can work with an installation specialist or home improvement contractor to bring the smart home of your dreams to life.
