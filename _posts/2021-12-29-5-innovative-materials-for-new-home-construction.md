The best housing materials will serve a number of purposes. For example, they must enhance the home’s durability, help make the building more energy-efficient, and improve the property’s aesthetics. To this effect, not all [building materials](/then-and-now-how-building-materials-have-changed-for-the-better/) are created equal. If you are planning your dream house, the following 5 materials are some of the most innovative options currently being used for new home construction.

### 1. Board and Batten Siding

If you are looking to make a bold, textured statement to enhance your home’s curb appeal, then you may want to consider [board and batten siding](https://innovativebuildingmaterials.com/board-and-batten-exterior-siding/) for creating the initial layer of your home’s building envelope. Although evidence of this “barn-style” siding stems back hundreds of years, it is increasingly popular among homeowners wanting to create a rustic flair for their property.

In the board and batten style, thin strips of molding (known as battens) are alternated between wider planks (boards). This alternating pattern of raised and recessed siding creates a textured finish that is not only visually pleasing, but provides many functional benefits, as well. Among these include:

* **Durability** - if you give this type of siding proper attention, it should last for many decades. Old barns employing the board and batten style are still in existence from the early 1900’s
* **Low maintenance** - while certain types of wood will require regular staining, there are numerous composite board and batten products that will maintain their appearance with little maintenance on the part of the owner
* **Affordability** - although it does take a little extra time to install board and batten, the component pieces can be obtained at a reasonable cost

### 2. Waterproof Sealant

While many people take steps for waterproofing their basement, the garage floor is another component of the home that should be waterproofed. This is because concrete, while durable, is a porous material that will stain and crack when left untreated. As the garage floor is sure to be subject to heavy outdoor foot traffic and dripping moisture from vehicles, it is critical to take steps to create a [waterproof garage floor](https://www.drylok.com/inspiration/blog/how-to-waterproof-garage-floor).

With this in mind, DRYLOCK® offers a number of moisture sealants that will perform the job admirably. Specifically, their latex garage floor paint will protect your new garage from traffic, chemicals, weather, and repeated cleanings, ensuring that your garage looks pristine years after it is built.

### 3. Hardwood Flooring Alternatives

There is no denying that hardwood floors create a stunning aspect in new homes. However, the price tag is not so pretty, with professional hardwood installations costing up to $12 per square foot.

Fortunately, there are innovative options that mimic the appearance of natural hardwood at a fraction of the cost. For example, luxury vinyl plank flooring comes in at around $5 per square foot and, thanks to its intuitive click-lock installation, can usually be installed without experienced professionals. While it may not enhance resale value like natural wood, vinyl plank flooring does have superior moisture resistance that will help keep the floors looking splendid for years to come.

### 4. Wind-Resistant Windows

Whether it be cracking from impact or degradation due to extended UV exposure, there is no shortage of ways in which your windows will be put to the test. As a result, inferior windows are one of the most likely culprits of unwanted air transfer, which will lead to elevated energy consumption and utility bills.

Due to this heavy strain, you don’t have to live next to the sea for it to be a good idea to have [hurricane rated windows](https://wincowindow.com/products/hurricane-resistant) installed as part of your new home. These windows provide protection from winds up to 250 MPH and offer elite defense against projectile debris. In addition, they can be fabricated in a number of attractive designs to enhance the curb appeal of a wide range of building fronts.

### 5. Composite Roofing

Roofing plays an important role in establishing both the insulation and curb appeal of your home. However, some of the most stunning and durable products, such as slate, Spanish barrel, or [terracotta roof](https://www.bravarooftile.com/blog/terracotta-roof/) tiles, can be cost-prohibitive.

As a result, contemporary homeowners are choosing to build with innovative composite roofing tiles. Fabricated from a combination of recycled paper, fiberglass, and asphalt, composite roofing tiles are rated to last 50 years and offer elite protection against moisture, UV, impact, and fire damage. Due to their synthetic nature, composite tiles can be fabricated in a wide array of colors and styles to match the design scheme of any new home.

The best building materials should be durable, energy-efficient, and aesthetically pleasing. In addition, they must be affordable enough for modern consumers to enjoy. To this effect, board and batten siding, DRYLOCK® waterproofers, hardwood flooring alternatives, wind-resistant windows, and composite roofing are 5 of the most innovative materials currently being used in new home construction.
