Is your kitchen beginning to show signs of the times—times that have passed, that is? Are you a century or more behind in the latest fashions? Well, you don’t have to go all-in for a complete overhaul to make a big difference. With some small, inexpensive changes you can refresh the look of your kitchen and revive your décor. Here we’ll look at some quick and easy ideas to give your kitchen a fresh new look for the 2015.

<h3>Paint Your Cabinets</h3>
One of the quickest and most cost effective changes that has a huge impact is painting your old cabinets and installing new hardware. If your cabinets are outdated but still sturdy, functional and the insides are on good shape, all you need is sandpaper, a bucket of paint, and new hardware to revamp one of the largest surface areas in your kitchen.  Whether you want to try out white cabinets with country-inspired hardware, adding color, or even a little of both, it’s all possible.  You can do-it-yourself or hire a professional.
<h3>Light Up Your Space</h3>
Lighting is another area that makes a big impact. Replace old lights with pendants and under-cabinet lighting, larger industrial lights, or recessed lights to bring a new ambiance to the space. Even a small change here can brighten up the entire room. Hand-blown pendants, wall sconces, or lights placed on the underside of cabinets can bring a glow into your kitchen and help distinguish otherwise overlooked spaces. If your kitchen currently has outdated fluorescent lighting, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the impact this change makes.

<h3>Open Up Your Kitchen</h3>
Open shelves are also trending these days. Consider replacing a cabinet door with a glass pane to highlight special pieces and bring depth to the kitchen. You can add a storage shelf to a blank wall for a functional display. Glass doors can make even ordinary pieces look like works of art, and frosted glass can bring a hint of depth without full disclosure. Or leave off the door altogether for open-air shelving and create a beautiful built-in display case. If your dishes are outdated, consider treating yourself to a brand new set. This is a quick and relatively inexpensive upgrade that can translate not only to a brighter, more stylish kitchen, but an updated dining experience as well.

<h3>Bring in Style with Tile</h3> 
Tired of that boring old backsplash? Consider replacing it with new stylish tiles. From stainless steel to glass mosaics, a stylish backsplash can make all the difference and add some spice to your kitchen space. If you have old wallpaper or cracked tile, you’ll be surprised at what a difference exchanging it for some new tiling can make. And as an added bonus, this project is also a great do-it-yourself endeavor that takes just a little bit of research to get acquainted with.
<h3>Make it New with Magnets and Hangers</h3>
Many happy homeowners make their kitchen accessories double as a functional art form. Install a pot-hanging rack above your stovetop and keep all your pots and kitchen utensils at just an arm’s reach away. This is especially helpful for those kitchens that are low on cabinet space. If your counters are cluttered, consider adding magnets to spice boxes or often-used cooking utensils and transform your refrigerator door into a quick and easy storage rack. Eliminate that knife block by installing a magnetic strip on a nearby wall and freely display your knife set to give your kitchen the air of a professional chef.
