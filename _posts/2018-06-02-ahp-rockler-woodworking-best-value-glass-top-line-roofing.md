Our Father's Day edition of the [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/the-approved-home-pro-radio-show-rockler-woodworking-best-value-glass-top-line-roofing/) includes [Rockler Woodworking](http://www.rockler.com/about-rockler/) inviting listeners to a special Make and Take class to craft a unique Father's Day gift. We also chat with Steve Welsh from [Best Value Glass](https://www.bvglass.com/) about why Milgard windows are the best in the business, and Wayne Sorensen at [Top Line Roofing](https://toplineroofing.com/) breaks down the dangers of ignoring your roof.

In our Cantor's Corner segment we talk [kitchen remodeling trends in San Diego](/highlights-from-the-2018-us-houzz-kitchen-trends-study/), including white cabinets, quartz countertops, farmhouse sinks, plank flooring, stainless steel appliances, and more.
