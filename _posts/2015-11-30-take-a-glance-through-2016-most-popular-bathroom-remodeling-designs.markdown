Sometimes called a wet room, this combination bathtub/shower/steam room is lavish, spacious, and modern. Floor-to-ceiling glass panels keep the steam and water inside, and the walk-in area gives you room for benches, stools, and shelves. Love your evening bath? Install a zen-like enclosed bath for soothing luxury.

This extremely accessible shower room instantly increases your home's value, as it is both ADA-approved and trendy. These rooms first originated in high-end spas and in modern homes across Europe, and the glass and spacious interior make it an elegant addition to any bathroom.

Because there is so much space in a wet room, there is plenty of room for the high-tech showerheads, water jets, and body sprayers that complete the spa-like ambiance. Multiple shower heads and LED display panels help you adjust the heat, pressure, steam, and even light. Trust us-the perfect shower or bath awaits with a new spa room in your master bathroom.

<strong>Media Amenities</strong>

Most newly-built bathrooms now include all kinds of high-tech gadgets, including everything from Bluetooth devices to wireless speakers and docking stations. Relaxing has never been easier-between the hot water, the beautiful atmosphere, and your favorite music or movie, you've got the best recipe for your perfect home space.

Dock a TV above the tub or inside the wall of your shower, or place it alongside your vanity so you can catch up on the news or Netflix while you get ready for work or relax at the end of the day. Waterproof devices and other tech innovations make your screens perfectly safe in your remodeled bathroom.

Love music? Combination showerheads and speakers make it easier than ever to listen to soothing music or your favorite audiobook in the shower. If you love the spa effect, be sure to install subtle speakers around the bathroom. Control panels will help you monitor everything in the room, including air and water temperature and volume control.

<strong>Heated Floors</strong>

Speaking of cool tech, 2016's hottest remodel trend may be heated floors. Heating pads (either electric or hydronic-water powered) are placed beneath the stone or tile of your bathroom. These energy-efficient pads enhance the natural thermal properties of the floor and create a cozy greeting for your toes on cold mornings.

Because heated floors generally use your home's heating system, the renovation is quick, simple, and affordable. Your ROI is high-home buyers will look for modern luxuries like heated floors in coming years, and your bathrooms' heated floors will look fantastic on your home listing.

Even if you decide not to invest in a heated floor, be sure to install inexpensive towel heaters. These handy devices will transform chilly, hurried mornings and give you a luxury that makes all the difference.

<strong>Focal Points</strong>

Next year's designs demand one thing loud and clear: a stunning focal point. This classic design element has stood the test of time and adds sophistication and class to any room that uses it well. And 2016's most beautiful bathrooms will use stand-alone tubs and floating vanities to capture the eye.

Free-standing tubs are elegant statement pieces. A unique, stylish tub can express your style faster than almost anything else, and with so many styles to choose from, you're sure to find the perfect tub. Floating vanities have a similar effect, and oil-rubbed bronze and brushed nickel are trendy materials to keep in mind while shopping.

At the very least, give your hardware a makeover. Outdated, rusty, or broken handles and faucets are unattractive and lower your home's value; worst of all, they distract the eye. Uniquely shaped faucets can give your bathroom a distinctive, chic style.

Last year's classic white color palette still holds sway, but accent pieces can give your white subway tiles a modern feel. Bright tiles with floral designs and bold colors lend your bathroom a fun or glamorous aura. Many homeowners love three-dimensional tiles, which add texture to the aesthetic appeal of the room. Accent lamps and daring light fixtures can complete your style.

If you want to be really daring, build a "living wall"-a wall covered in plants. These beautiful walls give your bathroom a natural, fresh, and even exotic appeal. They're easy to install and maintain, and they're absolutely gorgeous.
