After our extensive <a href="http://murraylampert.com/the-homeowners-guide-to-choosing-the-perfect-kitchen-backsplash/">kitchen backsplash guide</a>, here comes the list of exciting 2016 kitchen backsplash trends. If you are looking for something to make your kitchen stand out without spending a lot of money, a carefully chosen backsplash is just the thing.

You might be surprised to find out that less can actually be more in some cases. Check out these pro tips and design ideas.
<h3>No Tiles</h3>
Surprised? It seems that the biggest backsplash trend this season is the absence of backsplash! This shift makes perfect sense, though, especially when we know that the latest kitchen design trends have flirted with simplicity, clear lines and pastel colors. More and more home owners are opting for a simple coat of paint instead of tiles.

It all has to serve a purpose, though. If you choose to have a basic-paint backsplash, it should stand as a contrast to the color of the kitchen walls. For example, a contemporary kitchen might feature off-white or grey walls contrasted with a matte black backsplash. The bold choice of backsplash not only makes a statement, but is also aesthetically pleasing.
<h3>Black or White?</h3>
It’s common knowledge know that white kitchens are in vogue, but many home owners find all-white kitchen to be a bit too formal. Luckily, the ‘’traditional’’ black-and-white backsplash is making a big comeback and can do a great job in shaking up the formality of white kitchens. For really bold home owners, black backsplash against the trendy <a href="http://murraylampert.com/2016-kitchen-cabinet-trends">off-white cabinets and countertops</a> will definitely achieve the ‘’wow’’ effect.
<h3>Nautical Blue</h3>
A mosaic of glass tiles reminiscent of the sea blends in perfectly with off-white cabinets, stainless steel counter tops and a grey kitchen island. In contrast with the predominant black and white combo, blue always inspires a sense of freshness.

<h3>Chalkboard Turns Backsplash</h3>
Once reserved for chic cafes and restaurants, chalkboard has weaved its way into the kitchens of many enthusiastic American home owners. For starters, it’s incredibly easy to clean and so much fun to have around. The children are sure to go crazy about a part of the wall they can write on. What’s more, you can have your share of fun and write recipes or witty notes. When you are done with it, just take the sponge and remove the chalk. For this purpose, the preferred color for chalkboard backsplash is matte black, because it adds a touch of refinement when it’s clean, and looks so cool with the doodles on!
<h3>Mirrored Backsplash</h3>
A mirrored backsplash was first introduced with the aim of creating the illusion of a larger space. Very soon, it became a fashion statement, and (somewhat surprisingly) found its place within the shabby-chic movement. If you feel really creative, you can even write on it!
<h3>Ceiling-High Backsplash</h3>
Here comes a trend that will definitely give your kitchen a French bistro style – backsplash as high as the kitchen ceiling. It’s best suited for large open-space kitchens with high ceilings to begin with.
<h3>Earl Grey</h3>
It’s surprising that a color so dull could actually dominate contemporary kitchen design. On second thought, we have to admit that it’s the neutrality of grey that made it so popular. You can hardly go wrong by choosing grey as your kitchen backsplash color, because it blends into virtually any color scheme and style. However, the combination of a grey backsplash and black stainless-steel surfaces is still a wildly attractive option for many home owners.

<h3>Subway Tiles</h3>
No list of kitchen backsplash trends would be complete without subway tiles. They never seem to go out of fashion, in fact – kitchen designers love them so much that they manage to blend them with almost any style.

For more creative and trendy design solutions, consult a skillful designer. It is always good to get an expert opinion when it comes to different kitchen backsplash trends and finding the perfect one for your kitchen.
