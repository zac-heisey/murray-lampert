Why are our clients smiling?  Not only is high quality craftsmanship import, energy efficiency is too.  That's why when Mr. &amp; Mrs. F in San Diego remodeled their home, we installed a high efficiency tankless water heater.  The first full month, our homeowner saved approximately 26% on their gas bill.  This is an example of the many ways consumers can save on energy costs.  Many energy saving features are provided in normal construction at no cost.  And there are many rebate programs available at <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/">http://www.energy.ca.gov/</a>.
