We have been designing and building residential home remodeling projects since 1975, making us the oldest <a title="Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel" href="http://www.murraylampert.com">Design, Build and Remodeling firm in San Diego</a>.  As a 3 generation family business, I have seen major changes in the market and how home remodeling contractors have evolved.  Our success comes from continuing to expand our services without ever changing our core values which are providing innovative design, quality remodeling, reasonable pricing, great service and the best warranty in the business.

For approximately 35 years, we have provided design services for free, while most other home remodeling contractors charged. In 2012, I decided that we needed to offer our clients a more comprehensive design, including, <a title="San Diego Design &amp; Remodeling Services" href="http://http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-home-design-serivces/">space planning, elevations and 3D renderings</a>.  We started charging a nominal design fee that is applied toward the construction.  By offering expanded architectural design services and engaging our clients in the process, it completely changed our company.  Not only does it make it easier to meet clients lifestyle needs, we have tight control over construction costs and the ability to make adjustments so we can stay within budget.  Fixtures and finish costs are always identified up front before the contract is even signed.  This gives us the ability to value engineer too meet budgetary goals.  Our clients love this flexibility.

Another benefit of our expanded architectural design services is we identify structural and code requirements in advance.  This is especially valuable for second story additions where structural retrofitting is always required.  By having our engineer review the design, we can accurately price out the work.

For most home remodeling projects, working with one firm for <a title="Architectural Design &amp; Remodeling" href="http://http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-architectural-design-services/">architectural design and construction</a> is more cost effective and a better value for the homeowner.  It simplifies the entire process by providing design, engineering, permit processing, building and project management, from an experienced home remodeler, all under one roof.
