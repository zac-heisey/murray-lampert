The latest episode of the [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/approved-home-pros-radio-show-allegiance-heating-air-conditioning-inc-jamar-power-systems/) features Sarah Wood from [Allegiance Heating & Air Conditioning](http://allegianceheatingandairsd.com) discussing warning signs that your A/C is failing and is in need of service. We also have Phil Edwards from [Jamar Power Systems](http://jamarpower.com/) sharing some energy saving techniques to help homeowners save on their utility bills.

On this week's Cantor's Corner, we discuss what it means to a have a "historical" home in San Diego. If your home is 45 years or older, certain elements need to be addressed during the design process in order to meet certain requirements to maintain or achieve historical designation. Earning historical designation for your home allows you to apply for the [Mills Act](https://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/historical/faq/millsact), which can **save you up to 70% on property taxes**.
