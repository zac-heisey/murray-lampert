With a Second Story Additions, you can add more space without sacrificing your yard and sometimes even capture a view.

Most <a href="http://sdpublic.sdcounty.ca.gov/portal/page?_pageid=93,298373&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL">San Diego County homes</a> can accept a second floor with simple structural engineering and a design/build contractor who specializes in remodeling can put it all together.

Completing a <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-design-build-contractors/">conceptual plan</a> along with job specifications is the first step.  Then the contractor can accurately price out your project.  Since there will be foundation and structural modifications needed to prepare your home for the added load of a second story, a plan is needed to accurately price out the work.

<span style="font-size: 13.0208px;">Here are the steps required for a Second Story:</span>

1.  The Contractor meets with you to discuss your needs, takes measurements and checks existing site conditions.

2.  Floor plans and elevations are developed by the Contract.  Then the scope of work and price quote is drafted.

3.  If the price fits the your budget, contract documents are signed.

4.  The architect or designer makes another visit to your home to verify all the measurements.

5.  Working drawings are completed and after your approval they are sent to the structural engineer for calculations and details.

6.  After completion of the engineering, the marked up plans go back to the architect to complete the working drawings.  Then the final drawings are submitted to the City for permit.

7.  Timing for processing a building permit varies on the indivdual city and their workload at the time.  Typically it takes approximately 4 weeks for plan check to review the plans and send out corrections.  Depending on the nature of the plan checker's corrections, revised plans are usually re-submitted with 2 weeks.  The department approvals and final stamp out usually occurs within 2 weeks.

In summary, hiring a design build contractor instead of an independent architect is usually the best approach on second story addition.  You can find out the feasibility of building a Second Story with no out of pocket costs.

Hiring an architect is more expensive and generally architects are not familiar with the cost of remodeling.  The cost of developing plans is not refundable after you find out the work is not within your budget through contractor bids.
