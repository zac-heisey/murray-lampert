On the latest edition of the [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/the-approved-home-pro-radio-show-window-world-and-black-mountain-plumbing/), Gene Bryan from [Window World San Diego](http://www.windowworldsandiego.com/) talk about the differences between single pane, dual pane, and SolarZone Sunshield windows on your home's energy efficiency. Then we talk to Scott Ferrell from [Black Mountain Plumbing](https://blackmountainplumbing.com/) about how to spot a leak in your home's plumbing, and why it pays to work with a pro to get it fixed.

We wrap up this week's show with some details about Building Safety Month in San Diego. Homeowners and contractors can check out the Building Safety event on May 12th from 8am-12pm in Mission Valley to learn about things like fall protection, earthquake strapping, pool safety features, and more.
