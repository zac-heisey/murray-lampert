Few things are more exciting than remodeling your home to make it your own or match your updated style. That said, the [home remodeling](/san-diego-home-remodel-services) materials you use are instrumental in bringing together your vision as well as cementing the overall feel of your new space. Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel is here to offer you tips on how you can narrow down your options for remodeling materials. 

### Create a Foundation

Walk through the rooms you plan on remodeling and decide on a focal point that will serve as the fulcrum for your project. For instance, in your kitchen, that fulcrum could be the backsplash, or maybe it’s the fixtures in your bathroom. Decide on the centerpiece and build from there. Additionally, it can help if you browse through sites that offer a variety of materials for home remodel and styles to help spark some inspiration.

### Consider the Room

The specific room you’re renovating will also impact your overall decision. For countertops, you may prefer laminate for its affordability and the fact that it can be made to look like other materials, such as stone. When it comes to cabinets, decide if you want to go with stock, semi-custom or fully customized. The choices you make for your floors will be determined by how much traffic they get, how often you plan on cleaning them and what your overall budget is. 

### Think About the Style You Want To Achieve

Besides materials, you also have to think about the style of your house and individual rooms. For instance, would you prefer a modern style or something more rustic? Maybe you’d like to blend styles together to create something that’s uniquely yours. Either way, certain materials are a better match for certain styles, so be sure that you keep that in mind. 

### Know How To Work With Your Remodeling Contractor

Nailing your [remodeling project](/san-diego-remodel-project-gallery) is a group effort. While your tastes and input are a huge part of the equation, a home remodel is something that calls for professional expertise. [Developing a strong bond with your remodeling contractor](/complete-guide-to-choosing-the-right-home-remodeling-contractor/) is essential for a happy ending and stellar results. One of the first things you should do with your contractor is ask to see samples of her or his past work so that you have a solid idea of the type of results you can expect and the types of materials the company is familiar with. 

Before your first meeting with your contractor, you can save everyone involved a lot of time by bringing an idea book filled with images and samples of the look you’re going for with your remodel. That way, your contractor will know exactly what to show you and what looks you likely won’t care for.

### Know Where To Spend and Where To Splurge

Budget and cost are likely to be high on your list of concerns. If you plan on putting your home on the market in the next couple of years, you want to think about which changes and investment will net you the highest return on your investment. Energy-efficient appliances throughout your property can save you money as you do your part to take care of the environment. Splurge on a quality shower and toilet in your bathroom, and look into energy-efficient windows that keep in cool air in the summer and warm air in the winter, which can reduce the amount of energy your HVAC system uses. 

As for where to save money, you’re better off with new cabinets rather than customized ones, which are often more expensive. Flooring should be durable and easy to clean, and neutral colors are often better and less expensive than customized or unusual hues. Before you decide on a premium option, which is likely to be more expensive, try to find a less expensive selection that looks the same or so similar that it’s hard to tell the difference between the two.
