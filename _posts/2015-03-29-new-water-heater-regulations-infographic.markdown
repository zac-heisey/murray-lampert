There are new standards for water heaters required by the <a title="Water Heater Regulations" href="hotwater.com/naeca">U.S. Department of Energy</a>.  After April 15, 2015, all tank type water heaters manufactured in the U.S. will be larger in order to meet energy factor regulations.  If your existing water heater is in a closet and nearing the end of its lifespan, you should consider replacement while there are still old models in stock.  Here is a great infographic with more information:
