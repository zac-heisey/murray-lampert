With spring quickly approaching, now's the time to start thinking about those home remodeling projects you’ve put off all winter. [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/) is here to help you bring out the best in your home and whatever ideas you have. To that end, we’d like to offer a few ideas for spring home renovation. 

## Focus on the Kitchen

Spring is an ideal time of year to inject new life and energy into your kitchen, especially as the weather starts warming up. Focusing on your kitchen is especially good if you’re flirting with the idea of putting your property on the market. [San Diego kitchen remodels](/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services) often offer a sizeable return on investment, boosting the overall value of your home. 

## Infuse Color With the Right Rug 

Hardwood floors and carpets alike look great with a rug over them. For spring remodeling projects, select a rug with a bright color that reflects the season. A simple pop of color does wonders for a room as well as your mood.

## Consider Hardwood Floors 

No matter the style of your home or your interior design tastes, chances are good that hardwood floors would look divine throughout your property. The reason springtime is a good time of year for this particular project is the warm temperatures work in your favor. All the dust you’re bound to kick up with flooring installation can go right out an open door or window. This allows you to breathe easy (in more ways than one) while the project is being completed.

If you currently have hardwood floors, you can refinish, sand or re-stain them this spring. Again, being able to open your windows can ease the smell. 

## Reframe the Artwork in Your Home 

Rather than buy new artwork you may not be able to afford now or this spring, give your current art pieces a new look. Seek out new and exciting frames that match the rest of your new decor. Specifically, you may love the look and feel of gold or silver frames, colors that go with practically everything. Your home is sure to look like a new work of art with this tip. 

## Consider a Room Addition 

Rather than move to a house with more square footage, you may find it’s less of a hassle and less expensive to build onto your current residential property. Much like with installing hardwood floors, the warm temperatures of the spring season can make this particular remodel more bearable. Even if you don’t plan on having an elderly relative or college-aged son or daughter move in, a [room addition](/san-diego-room-additions) or [Accessory Dwelling Unit](/san-diego-in-law-suites) can still be a great idea. For instance, you can think about renting the room out to a tenant to make some extra money on the side. If you go this route, just make sure you follow the latest laws and regulations for your specific location. 

## Give Your Driveway a Touch-up

As you’re focusing your remodeling efforts inside your house, don’t forget about the exterior. While a durable material, asphalt is still susceptible to damage. Over time, that damage can harm the structural integrity of your driveway, leading to unsightly cracks. Look into resurfacing your driveway, or at least a way to protect its overall functionality. Moisture and warm temperatures create the ideal conditions for asphalt.

## Color Your Ceiling

Rather than make the ceilings of all the rooms in your house the same colors as the walls, try something new. A blue ceiling in a room with cream walls draws the eye upward and makes quite a statement. Another great thing about changing the color of your ceiling is the fact that it’s an inexpensive way to refresh the overall vibe of any room in your home. 

## Install Energy-Efficient Windows 

Some remodeling ideas help you save money while giving your property a facelift. Your current windows could be making your HVAC unit work harder by allowing cooled and warmed air to escape through gaps. [Installing new energy-efficient windows](/efficiency-sound-insulation-curb-appeal-with-new-windows/) can lower your energy bills and raise your overall savings. Have a professional come and check the current condition of your windows to see how good of an investment new windows could be. Additionally, look into new window treatments to reinvigorate a room this upcoming spring.
