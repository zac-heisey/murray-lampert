The Preliminary Design Phase is where the Design/Build contractor meets with you to discuss your needs, measures the existing building, confirms property lines/setbacks, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">verify</span> utilities, and checks out over all site conditions.

This process typically takes a few weeks, and requires a few meetings to develop final design drawings. With a final design, an accurate quote can be provided.

You will be asked to go out and do some shopping so that accurate fixture and finish allowances can be plugged in.

A competent Design/Build firm will provide you with an overall budget, including items that you may contract/pay for direct.

At Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel, we assist our clients in purchasing fixtures and finishes with our contractors discount. This helps with reaching a common goal, to provide a construction package that fits your needs and budget.
