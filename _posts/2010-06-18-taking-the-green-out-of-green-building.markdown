By now, most Amercians are familiar with "Going Green".  Green practices include everything from paperless offices, turning off lights to consvere energy, alternative energy, and Green Building.

Some people believe Green is entirely politicaly driven.  As a builder, I believe Green practices are worthy of consideration but I am not a Green "pusher".

In home remodeling, typically only a small portion of a home is affected, and in most cases, making the entire home "Green" is cost prohibitive.

Some of the Green practices we include in our work at no extra charge to our clients are:

Recycling of Construction Waste

Lead Paint &amp; Asbestos Testing

Ugraded Insulation

Radiant Barrier Over Roof Sheeting to Reflect Heat

Energy Efficient Windows, Doors and Skylights

Engineered Woods For Structural Construction

Fluorescent Lighting

Programmable Thermostats

Storm Water Pollution Control

Low Flow Toilets, Faucets and Valves

My philosophy on Going Green is if everyone does their part even in a small way the results will be tremendous.
