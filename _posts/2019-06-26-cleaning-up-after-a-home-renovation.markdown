Carrying out major changes to your home can greatly improve the appearance and add to its value. New floors, windows, and other changes can breathe new life into your home, but renovations aren't without their work. One of the biggest challenges that most homeowners run into after the builders have left is [cleaning up](https://murraylampert.com/easy-ideas-to-kick-off-your-spring-cleaning/), which can take days or weeks. These tips can help you get back to normal faster after a renovation has been completed.

## Start with the Walls 

The walls are the first place you should start as there’s a good chance they've got some dust and other dirt on them. If the walls have been painted, simply dust them and then move on. If not, then clean the walls, especially molding where dirt and dust easily gather. If the walls have a textured paper, vacuum them using the brush attachment. Other wallpapers that aren't textured can be wiped down with a damp cloth.

## Clean Vents and Replace Filters

Even if it's not time to replace the filters yet, any renovation is going to add dust into the home. If you have only renovated a section of the house, it's still a good idea to treat the air vents and filters as they will be full of dust. This is especially crucial if anyone living in the house is allergic to dust. Start by removing vent covers and cleaning them with soap and water. Replace the filters before replacing the vent covers.

## Vacuum Upholstery

This is an area that's often missed but any cushions and soft furnishings are a magnet to dust and debris. If covers can be replaced and washed, put them in the washing machine for a thorough clean. For any other upholstered fabric including mattresses, use the upholstery attachment on your vacuum. Use this attachment to also clean curtains or blinds. 

After you've vacuumed the upholstery, you'll want to use a damp cloth to wipe down the wood and metal parts of the furniture. Any picture frames or other miscellaneous items should also be wiped down. Using a damp cloth is often more effective but a duster often works well.

Since your vacuum is probably the most important tool you're going to be using in the cleanup, then you'll want to invest in a good quality vacuum. [A powerful vacuum cleaner](https://cleanhomeguide.co.uk/shark-duoclean-cordless-review/) will be able to get dirt and dust from all surfaces, and will also have lots of attachments to clean hard-to-reach areas. If you don't have a good vacuum cleaner, then you may want to consider upgrading.

## Clean The Lights 

Lights and light fixtures can build up dust, and it's a good idea to take down the fixtures if possible and clean them. They can be cleaned with hot water and soap. Fan blades attract a lot of dust, and a simple wipe with a duster will be sufficient to clean them. Ensure that you clean and dust them before using the fan to avoid spreading any dust.

## Wipe Down All Hard Surfaces

With the fixed surfaces in your home, such as cabinets and [countertops](https://murraylampert.com/7-things-to-know-about-granite-kitchen-countertops/), it’s a good idea to start at the top and then clean them to the base. After cleaning the top of counters, clean the interior, making sure to get all for the hard-to-reach corners. If you left items in the cabinets, you may want to remove them for a more thorough clean. Any items in the cabinets such as dishes or pans may also benefit from being washed before replaced.

## Clean Floors Last

The floors should be the last thing that you clean as any dirt and dust from the rest of the house will accumulate on the floors. Cleaning them earlier will result in more dust landing on your floors, this is why it’s recommended to start at the top of the room and work your way down.

Start by sweeping up any large particles if needed and then follow up with a thorough vacuum. Once you have finished vacuuming, give any hard floors such as wood and tile a good mopping. You may have to mop several times to ensure your floors are clean.
  
After following these steps, you can enjoy a newly renovated and clean home. As a general rule, it's a good idea to start cleaning from top to bottom as dust will settle over time. This process ensures that you get all areas of the house. To make sure that you clean every surface in your home, be methodical and take the time to be thorough. You'll be much happier with the end result.
