The city of San Diego regulates construction  for the safety of all residents, as well as for the preservation of certain  areas of this great county. Visit the <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/index.shtml">City  of San Diego</a> website for more detailed information and  guidelines on how to obtain the appropriate permits, or contact them at <a href="mailto:dsdweb@sandiego.gov">dsdweb@sandiego.gov</a>.
<h2>What types of permits are there?</h2>
There are several different types of permits,  based on the type of construction: <strong>structural</strong>, <strong>plumbing</strong>, <strong>mechanical</strong>, <strong>electrical</strong> and <strong>combination, </strong>which are generally  obtained for single-family homes and other small projects. Most residential  projects require a combination permit.
<h2>What types of construction require a permit?</h2>
Complete demolition, relocation of buildings, and new  construction always require a permit, and they generally require a combination  permit that covers the structural, plumbing, mechanical and electrical  components of your project.  Certain  types of renovations require permits.
<h2>What home improvements don’t require a permit?</h2>
Any superficial changes to your home do not require permits.  If you are merely painting, or redecorating, permits are generally unnecessary.  Fences up to six feet high, as well as platforms, decks, and walkways up to  thirty inches high do not require permits. General plumbing, electrical, or  mechanical repair work such as adjusting or replacing faucets, switches, and  linings does not require a permit.
<h2>Minor work permits:</h2>
There are types of minor home improvements that only require  permits, but can be issued easily through the Inspection Services Office. If  you need to move an electrical outlet, or install a water heater, this is the  type of permit for you. Contact the city’s <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/contact/servmap2.shtml">Inspection  Services Office</a> at (858) 492-5070.

If you are planning to pursue a home improvement project, be  sure to have a licensed design build contractor, architect or <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-home-design-services/">designer</a> draft the plans for your project first.   With properly drafted and engineered plans the necessary permits can be obtained easily.  Your contractor should be responsible to call and pass all the required inspections.
