Mr. &amp; Mrs. D in San Diego recently had a closet and home office added.  Their daughter has decided to make it her new play area.<a href="http://murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Dang3.jpg"></a>

Many of our clients have the need for extensions to existing rooms, bedroom additions, home offices, or even private space for parents of children moving back in.  

Listening to the individual needs of a homeowner and delivering a finished project that is high quality, funcitonal, and adds value is the goal of a a good contractor.  

This project took 2 months to build.  Now Mr. &amp; Mrs. D and their daughter are happily enjoying their very functional space.
