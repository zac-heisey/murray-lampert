As a strong advocate for truth in advertising and consumer support, I feel compelled to write this editorial about the local “Best of...” awards.  These competitions are driven by consumer votes and awards are given based on the number of votes received.  I’ve noticed that some companies are paying for advertising to generate votes while others are offering incentives like Visa gift cards in exchange for votes.  The entry guidelines do not regulate such things as multiple votes from the same source nor do they require documentable proof of claims as to why a firm deserves status as “best” in any industry or endeavor.

After receiving the Better Business Bureau’s Torch Award for Marketplace Ethics, I have to express my appreciation to the Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel team.  The difference between receiving a Torch Award and being named Best of San Diego is huge.  To be considered for a BBB Torch Award, an extensive entry binder has to be created and submitted, documenting a company’s ethical business practices and achievements.  All entries are reviewed by an independent panel of judges and graded based on four important criteria to determine a company’s commitment to ethics and integrity.  This unbiased competition is open to BBB members and non-members, and is based on merit and actual achievements not by buying online ads, print ads or consumers votes.

Winning the Better Business Bureau Torch Award was a major accomplishment for which I am proud to recognize my team members for showing the kind of dedication to quality, attention to detail, customer satisfaction, and community service participation which obviously was apparent to the judges.  Receiving an award for the true merits and attributes of our company makes me extremely proud.

Gregg Cantor, President
