In Part 2 of our short guide on hose to choose the right home remodeling contractor for your project, we've outlined 9 tips to help you find, vet, and select a trustworthy contractor. You can [check out Part 1 here](/how-to-choose-a-contractor-for-successful-home-remodeling-part-1/).

1. Build a list of contractors to interview by asking friends, relatives, neighbors and doing online research. We strongly suggest [working with a design-build firm](/why-choose-design-build-for-your-home-project/) to ensure your project is managed properly and completed on time and on budget.

2. Visit [www.cslb.ca.gov](http://www.cslb.ca.gov) and verify licensing, worker's compensation, and bonding. You should also visit [www.bbb.org](http://www.bbb.org) to check a company's grade and complaint history. Use Google Maps to make sure the companies have a physical location and are not run out of garage or truck.

3. After completing steps 1 and 2, grade your the prospective contractors on list and contact the top 3 to schedule an in-person interview.

4. Ask for past and current references. **Call at least 5 references** of completed projects, and consider visiting 2 or 3 past or in-progress projects. When interviewing references, ask if the contractor finished on time and within budget. Find out how unforeseen conditions were handled and if the site/home was kept safe and clean throughout the project.

5. Request proof of liability, worker's compensation insurance, and a certificate naming you as additional insured.

6. Meet the project manager that will be assigned to your job. This person will be your primary point of contact throughout your project, so establishing a good rapport is important.

7. Ask for a copy of the contractor's warranty.

8. Before you sign a contract, make sure everything is included, and the finishes/fixture allowances cover the quality/grade you want. Make sure the payment schedule is reasonable and that the last payment is substantial enough to ensure the final punch list is completed timely and to your satisfaction.

9. During construction, request conditional lien releases with each progress payment and an unconditional lien release/releases upon making the final payment. Do not make the final payment until the inspector has signed off on everything.
