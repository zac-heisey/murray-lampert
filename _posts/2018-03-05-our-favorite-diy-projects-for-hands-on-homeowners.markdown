Do you find yourself frequently scouring Pinterest for new and creative Home DIY projects? You’re not alone. There are plenty of us who actually enjoy weekend projects around the house… as long as we can put our creativity to work! We’ve searched high and low to find you interesting DIY home projects to keep you entertained this season. Dust off your toolboxes, here is a list of our favorite projects to try this spring.

### 1. Repaint Your Kitchen Cabinets

We’ll be honest with you, this is not a DIY project for the faint of heart. The sandpapering alone is enough to drive amateurs to failure. But, if you love hands-on home projects and your [kitchen cabinets](\/san-diego-custom-cabinet-construction-services) are circa 2000, this might be the DIY project for you.

There are countless step-by-step guides on Pinterest, and we’ve looked through many of them. We love this tutorial by Oriana Gomez-Zerpa, [How to Paint Kitchen Cabinets in 5 Easy Steps.](https://mykukun.com/how-to-paint-kitchen-cabinets-5-easy-steps/)

### 2. Build Your Own Bar Cart

Bar carts have become extremely popular in recent years, and you don’t have to be a drinker for one to enliven your space. Like a bookshelf, a bar cart can display art or other decor pieces that show off your home style and add visual interest.

If you research ideas for building your own bar cart at home, you might find a lot of Ikea hacks. There is nothing wrong with that, but if you’re looking to create something a bit more unique, we found a few DIY bar cart tutorials that are worth considering.

### 4. Recycle an old drawer into a rustic hanging shelf!

Do you have an old dresser that you’ve been holding on to but really need to donate? Consider transforming one of the drawers into a floating shelf! We love the idea of repurposing a dresser drawer into a rustic, decorative shelf for the bathroom. The size of the drawer can dictate the items you display in it. Large enough drawers can display washcloths or small bath towels. Smaller drawers might display a family picture or coral statue. You decide!

### 6. DIY Pet or Baby Gate

Do you have furry friends or tiny tots at home? Keeping them safe and out of harms way is a must, especially if you have two stories. Let's face it, most of the baby and pet gates that you’d find in the store are boring. They’re made from metals and plastics and lack character.

You can easily build your own gate to fit your style at home! We found this easy[ DYI baby or pet gate tutorial](https://www.hometalk.com/11977039/10-minute-diy-baby-pet-gate?r=0) from Finding Purpose Furniture on the Home Talks blog!

### 7. Build a Pet Food Storage Container

Speaking of furry friends, many of us have large dogs in San Diego. With large dogs comes large bags of food that can be clunky to store. Not to mention, the dog food bowl area can get messy. We love the idea of creating a station for fido to chow down that also provides storage.

We searched high and low for a great tutorial. and found this [step-by-step article from the Happy Go Lucky Blog](https://www.happygoluckyblog.com/2015/10/diy-dog-food-station-with-storage.html). Not only does this pet food station have built in dog food bowls, but it has enough storage for a large bag of kibble!

### 8. Design a Romantic Canopy Bed

If you’re looking for ways to create more romance your home, it doesn’t get any better than a canopy bed. Most homeowners shy away from canopy beds because they lack the hardware and expertise. But the truth is, you don’t need special bed, a large budget, and serious DIY skills to pull this off.

Not only is this DIY project very budget friendly, but you’ll create a soft and relaxing atmosphere that you can enjoy with your loved one for years to come.
