A great starting point for researching home remodeling companies is the Better Business Bureau, <a href="http://www.bbb.org/">http://www.bbb.org/</a>. You can compare grades, see how many years the company has been in business, who the principles are, and complaint history. You can also link from the Better Business Bureau to the Contractors License Board to see if the license is in good standing, there is worker's compensation insurance in place, and an active bond for your protection.

In most markets, the BBB is the most respected non-profit organization that offers information about businesses in order to protect consumers. The Torch Awards are an example of how the BBB rewards business for marketplace ethics.

I also suggest getting to know the companies by checking out their individual websites. This will give you insight on how much staffing a company has, and examples of the projects they take on.

The best way to check out a home remodeling contractor is by asking neighbors, friends and family. Choosing companies that have been in business over 10 years is advisable. Chances are, you will know others that have dealt with established companies so you can get real experiences.
