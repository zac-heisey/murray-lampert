## Key Takeaways from Houzz's 2018 Bathroom Trends Study

#### Aging in Place is a Growing Concern
More than half of baby boomers surveyed are addressing either current or future needs of aging in place when it comes to master bathroom renovations. These renovations include completely new bathroom layouts, low-curb and zero entry showers, non-slip floors, handle and seat installation, and more.

#### New Buyers Want New Bathrooms
Rather than master [bathroom renovations](/san-diego-bathroom-remodeling-services) being motivated by pent-up demand, more bathroom renovations are the result of a recent home purchase. These desire for new homeowners to personalize the bathroom in a recently purchased home has steadily increased over the last 3 years.

#### Master Suite Renovations are the Norm
Nearly half of master bathroom renovations (46%) are paired with a [master bedroom remodel](/san-diego-room-additions), with the most commonly upgraded features being faucets, wall finishes, and flooring. The national average spend on a master bathroom remodel is $7,000, which jumps to $16,000 for major bathroom remodels of 100+ square feet.

#### Style Changes Lead the Way
A whopping 91% of respondents reported changing the style of their master bathroom. Contemporary and transitional styles remain at the top of the list, while farmhouse style continues to gain ground. When it comes to stylistic details, metal finishes such as matte nickel and polished chrome, as well as brick tiling, are popular options.
