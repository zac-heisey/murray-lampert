When you evaluate contractors, what attributes are important?

Consider these questions:

Does a company with awards and high rankings through trade publications deliver more value?  Do these awards come from meeting their client’s needs and budget or designing for their own benefit and not always in the homeowner’s best interest? 

What is a national ranking?  Is it self serving in that all a company needs to do is submit to a trade publication?  How important is a ranking purely based on dollar volume? 

What is more credible, a “best of” competition driven by a media publication or website selling ads to encourage votes, or an award won after submitting a comprehensive entry package that is graded by a panel of independent judges?

Winning readers polls and being recognized by trade magazine may be great window dressing, but do they really mean anything to you?

Here are meaningful attributes:

Online reviews written by homeowners about their experience with the builder.

Being recognized in the community with awards for ethics and integrity.

Having a reputation for completing quality work on time and within budget.
