Get in the swing this Spring by freshening up your home’s interior. You don’t need to go crazy with a full redesign to enliven your home for spring. A few updates can make a huge difference!

Our friends at West Elm, Pottery Barn, and Anthropologie have been teasing spring trends for weeks now. We've been working hard to uncover the top [2018 home remodeling trends](/2018-home-remodeling-trends/), and below are four interior design ideas we think are perfect for Spring.

### 1. Pastels

We’re seeing pastels everywhere! From bedding to pillows, shams, and throw blankets, pastels are taking over Spring. Think watery yellows, soft bubble-gum pinks, pistachio green, or lavender purples. Pastels are a color trend that will surely carry into Summer, so don’t shy away from incorporating more pastels into your home!

### 2. Geometric Patterns and Textures

You don’t need to have a modern style home to incorporate geometric patterns and textures. We’ve seen the coziest of homes add touches of geometry and it just works! You can easily add fun visual patterns and textures to your living room, bedroom, bathroom or office. Small updates and upgrades can go a long way when you’re trying to freshen up your home for Spring and Summer!

Place one or two on your living room floor near the coffee table, or add one to a corner of your bedroom with a chunky knit blanket. We love how cozy, fun and inviting you can make a room feel when you incorporate this fun Spring trend!

### 4. Plants On Plants On Plants

This Spring more than ever, it will be all about foliage. Time to work on your green thumb, because plants are taking interior design by storm! Design savvy homeowners are filling their homes with oxygenating plants and for good reason. They help clear toxins from the air, reduce pollutants, and simply look gorgeous.

You’d be surprised at how many low maintenance house plant options there are. We all live busy lives, and adding more plants to your home should add benefits to it, not complicate it.

Some of our favorite low maintenance indoor plants include:

-Snake Plant/Mother in Law’s Tongue
-English Ivy
-Boston Ferns
-Dracena
-Cat Palms
-Various Cacti
