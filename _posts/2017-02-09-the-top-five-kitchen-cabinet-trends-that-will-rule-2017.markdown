Kitchen cabinets typically occupy the largest portion of your kitchen’s landscape and are usually the first thing to catch your guests’ eyes. Therefore, your new flooring or fancy appliances won’t mean much if your cabinets are scruffy and out of style.

This is one of the main reasons homeowners choose to give their kitchen a new life with a brand new, trendy cabinetry setup. Other times homeowners find that their cabinets don’t provide enough space for all their needs.

If you recognize your kitchen in either of these examples, maybe it’s high time you considered finally replacing your old cabinets? Luckily for you, we have the list of the hottest kitchen cabinet trends that are going to be huge in 2017.

**Kitchen Cabinet Color Trends**

The first thing homeowners consider when choosing their new kitchen cabinets is the color. They have to fit in with the backsplash, the appliances and the overall style of their kitchen. This year, the unmistakable gray kitchen cabinets are being updated with warmer shades of gray, enriched with a purple undertone.

When it comes to the lower cabinetry, blue is by far the most popular color. It is perfect as it gives the kitchen a bright now look and breaks the monotony of monochromatic appliances. Deep green cabinets coupled with brass fixtures, marble countertops and backsplashes will help bring luxury into your kitchen, while soft mint could help bring out the natural side of your kitchen.

**Glass Cabinets**

The [kitchen cabinet trend that took 2016 by storm](/2016-kitchen-cabinet-trends-something-for-everyone) is still going strong according to many designers. It's a great alternative to the increasingly popular open shelving options, as glass front cabinets provide shelter from dust and can keep your glassware and dishes clean. It is the best of both worlds and allows for even more experimentation, for example by using different types of glass.

**Chalk Paint**

This one is the most popular trend with DIY enthusiasts. If you are looking to bring out the rustic side of your kitchen and give your kitchen a vintage vibe, chalk paint can help you with that. It gives your cabinetry an aged vibe and fits perfectly with farmhouse-style kitchens.

**Metal Cabinets**

The metallic kitchen cabinets are making a huge comeback. Homeowners <a href="http://murraylampert.com/what-metal-should-you-use-in-your-kitchen/">choose this material</a> not only because it fits in perfectly with most kitchen appliances, but also because metallic cabinets are easier to maintain and will stay in top shape for years and years to come.

**Stylish Fixtures**

Maybe your cabinets are already perfect in every aspect. The functionality, color, and shape are all in place, yet you feel like there’s something a bit off about them. Our designers recommend paying attention to the finest details in 2017. One thing you could change to give your cabinets a great new feel is the hardware. Replace old pulls and knobs with new, stylish ones that will accent the nature of your kitchen better.

This year is all about streamlined shapes and chromatic materials. This little project might not take more than an afternoon but is sure to bring a fresh new look to your cabinets and your kitchen. And while you’re at it, you might finally want to replace those screeching hinges.
