This week on the [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/approved-home-pros-radio-show-allegiance-hvac-berger-hardware-murray-lampert/), we talk to Cheryl Robertson and Eric Seville from [Berger Hardware](https://www.bergerhardwareinc.com/) about choosing the right fixtures and finishes during the home remodeling process. We also have Sarah Wood from [Allegiance Heating & Air Conditioning](http://allegianceheatingandairsd.com/) explaining the ins and outs of whole house fans.

Finally, we finish up by discussing the importance of order when it comes to the trades, materials, etc. in a remodeling project, and how working with a [design-build contractor](/san-diego-design-build-contractors) can help simplify and streamline the process.
