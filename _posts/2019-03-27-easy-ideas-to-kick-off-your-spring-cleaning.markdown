Winter is almost over. For most of us, this is a time of celebration. We can finally throw the windows open and bring out the clothes we actually look forward to wearing. Goodbye heavy coats and itchy sweaters, and hello once more to cargo shorts, sundresses, polo shirts and sandals. It’s also a time to entertain, and that means spring cleaning before company comes by. Here are some easy and perhaps unlikely cleaning tips to kick off your spring cleaning this year.

## Disinfect the Sink

Believe it or not, your kitchen sink and your dish sponge both have more germs than your toilet seat. It’s insane, but it’s also true. Use your dish soap to wash the sink, and then rise. Spray with vinegar, wait a minute or so, then spray some hydrogen peroxide as well. To cut odors in the sink, drop ice cubes, salt and lemon pieces down the disposal.

## Use Lemon To Remove Water Stains

Water stains can dull the sheen of your faucets in the kitchen and bathroom. Instead of spending money on cleaners, consider a more environmentally friendly option. Cut a lemon in half and rub it on the water stains to have your faucets sparkling like brand new again. 

## Seal Your Countertops

Natural stone makes for beautiful countertops, and stone like granite can really help your home value to climb. However, natural stone can also be porous, leading to their deterioration as well as creating a breeding ground for bacteria. To combat this, natural stone cleaners recommend that you seal these [kitchen countertops](/the-most-popular-materials-for-kitchen-countertops/) and then reseal them a year later.

## Use an Onion To Clean the Grill

Before you fire up that grill, spray the grates with white vinegar. This will help to loosen any residue left over from your last cleaning. Then, cut a large onion in half and use it to wipe any remaining residue away.

## Make Stainless Steel Sparkle

Chances are, you’re like many of the Americans who converted their appliances to stainless steel. They are beautiful — but not when they’re dull. Use stainless steel cleaners once or twice per week to maintain their shine. 

## Clear Away Showerhead Buildup

Vinegar is pretty useful in the bathroom as a cleaner, especially when it comes to dissolving mineral deposits. If your showerhead hasn’t been spraying full force lately, then the problem may be the mineral buildup. Pour vinegar into a plastic bag and use elastic bands to fix it to the shower head. Leave it there overnight. In the morning, remove the plastic bag and run the shower for a few minutes. You should notice an immediate difference.

## Put Old Newspapers To Use

If you’ve been spending a lot of money on window cleaners, we have another eco-friendly alternative. Purchase a spray bottle or simply repurpose an old one. Fill it with 2 teaspoons of liquid soap, a quarter cup of vinegar and 2 cups of water. Spray onto windows and mirrors and scrub with newspaper to create a streak-free shine. 

## Spot Clean the Walls

If you have children or pets, your walls probably take a hard beating every year. Use a sponge or cloth and some water to spot clean away most of the damage. If you have leftovers of the paint color, a quick touchup may also help to hide some of the blemishes.

## Wash the Washing Machine

Yes, really. Washing machines can start to get smelly after continued use, which then begins to affect your clothes. Clean it by starting a wash cycle with hot water. Then, add baking soda and distilled white vinegar. Let this sit for a half an hour to an hour and then run the machine again. After the water drains, wipe the machine dry with a clean cloth.

## Wash the Bedding

You should already wash your sheets and pillowcases at least every two weeks. But, what about the pillows and the comforter set? Check the labels and follow the guidelines, but typically, you should be able to wash these at least bi-annually in the washing machine.

## Get Rid of Extras

If you’ve been wondering “[how can I declutter my home?](/keeping-small-spaces-organized/)” then you’ll find the best starting point isn’t organizing, but getting rid of things you don’t need. One good rule of thumb is that if you haven’t used something for more than six months to a year, it’s a good idea to toss it. Naturally, seasonal items are an exception. You can donate the things you don’t need, sell them online or hold a yard sale.

## Organize the Closet

The best kept secret of many organized rooms is a disorganized closet stuffed to bursting. With the extras gone, this will be a much easier issue to resolve. Use plastic space savers to stack bed linens and seasonal clothes that are not in use. You may also find shoes racks for the heels and gentlemen's shoes. Having a system also makes it easy to find things when you need them, whether you choose to go by color, length or function.

## Win the Fight Against Fur

Winning the fight against fur begins with our [pets](/pet-friendly-home-remodeling/) rather than our homes. Dogs should be bathed at least once every three months but can be bathed as often as every two weeks. This helps to wash away the fur that would otherwise end up on your furniture and carpet. Routine grooming with a de-shedder brush is great for cats and is also useful for dogs. Vacuuming frequently will pick up the rest. To tackle pet smells, especially from a litter box, you should consider a HEPA filter.

## Clean as You Go

This is a long list and the longer you go without cleaning, the longer it becomes. To keep your home always looking spring-clean fresh, it’s best to clean and organize as you go. For example, wash dishes after use, put laundry away after washing and clean up spills as they happen.
