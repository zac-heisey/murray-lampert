Engineered stone is solid surface slabs manufactured out of quartz and made into sheets.  The most common names are Silestone and Caesarstone.

<strong>Pros</strong>
Very consistent coloring with no veining.  Uniform slab sizing.

<strong>Cons</strong>
Pricing is comparable to natural granite and colors are limited.

<strong>Summary</strong>
Engineered stone manufactures claim that their product is more durable than granite.  I do not find this to be true, and there is very little savings over granite slab.  If you want something unique that fits your style, granite is a better choice.
