Many people are outgrowing the space in their homes only to find that larger homes are more costly and selling their old home is difficult given the current market trends. [Adding a second story](/san-diego-second-story-addition) to your home instead of relocating can increase the square footage substantially without taking away from your [outdoor living space](/san-diego-outdoor-living-space-design).

Below are a few questions you should ask yourself before deciding if you should look into building that second story onto your home.

#### Do You Love Your Existing Neighborhood?

Many people feel they need more space, but they struggle with leaving a neighborhood that they love, especially if their children have been in the same school district for a long time. Building a second story on your home provides the space you need without having to move away from the area.

#### Do You Have a Small Lot?

Adding a second story to your home allows you to add the square footage you need without having to give up your outdoor space. With additional bedrooms and bathrooms, adding a second story increase the re-sale value of your home.

#### Would You Like A Balcony or Other Custom Features?

Adding a second story to your home allows you to add design features that don't exist in your current home. You can move your bedroom upstairs, have a small balcony or build a private office. You can also add built-in bookshelves and make rooms as large or small as you choose. When building, you get to decide architectural style, such as add a spiral staircase, vaulted ceilings or any other elements to make your home distinctive from the others on your block.Â  The addition of second story may also help you capture a view.

#### Are Your Parents Aging?

Many older people are choosing to live with family rather than in assisted-care facilities when they can no longer live alone. In addition to an [in-law suite](/san-diego-in-law-suites), adding a second story to your home provides an option to free up space on your first floor for aging parents who may have trouble going up and down stairs. The second story then allows you to give your parents privacy while still being close enough to help if necessary.

There are many benefits to building a second story, from caring for family to increasing the value of your home. So before you begin thinking of moving, consider moving up instead of out.
