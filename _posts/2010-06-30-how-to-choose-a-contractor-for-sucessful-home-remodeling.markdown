I have been a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contractor</span> for over 25 years, always living by honesty, integrity, transparency, and full disclosure.

The key to the success of our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">home remodeling projects</span> of any size is that we listen to our clients needs and work within their budget.  We design our projects accordingly and assist our clients in choosing the elements that go into their home up front to avoid cost overruns.

Unfortunately, when consumers interview and ultimately hire a contractor for their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">home improvements</span>, it is not always a level playing field.

Here are some common tactics to watch out for:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor</span> has you sign a design retainer where in you are obligated to pay substantial up front costs.  Typically the agreement states that the contractor estimates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">construction</span> cost between X and Y.  Not only are you paying for an estimate, there is no guarantee the contractor will ultimately build your project for the “estimated” price range.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor</span> and homeowner enter into a contract where in allowances are called out.  Later on you find out the allowances do not cover the caliber of fixtures and finishes desired.  Then the infamous change order comes.  You are caught with the choice substandard fixtures and finishes or approving an expensive change order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor</span> chosen is substantially lower then other bidders.  When it is too late, you find out why when change orders are delivered on a regular basis.  Some contractors knowingly under cut their competition and try to make up the shortfall with change orders.

During <span style="text-decoration: underline;">construction</span>, when you request a change, mark up is accelerated.  Sometimes the profit margin is 100% over cost.  Another words, you are charged $1,000 for something that costs $500.

My next post will have advice/steps on choosing a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contractor</span> wisely and how to enter into a contract so the end result will be a successful, cost effective <span style="text-decoration: underline;">home remodel</span>.
