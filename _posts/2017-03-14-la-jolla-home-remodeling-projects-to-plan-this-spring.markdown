With warmer months ahead, you definitely don’t want to wait for the full heat blast to schedule a <a href="http://murraylampert.com/major-renovations/">major home remodel</a>. La Jolla homeowners, just like homeowners anywhere in San Diego, should start planning any major home improvement project now if they want everything to be done before the summer heat.

Here are a couple of major home remodeling projects you will need to plan thoroughly, which means – the planning starts now.
<h2>Kitchen Remodels</h2>
When it comes to the return on investment a kitchen remodel brings, California is still #1 in the U.S. In 2014, the Remodeling Magazine estimated that homeowners in the Pacific region <a href="http://murraylampert.com/infographic-national-averages-for-cost-and-return-on-investment/">recouped up to 89% of the cost</a> of a mid-range major kitchen remodel.

The <a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/">figures for 2016</a> show a slight decline in the recouped cost percentage compared to 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless, the figures are still encouraging: homeowners who had major home remodels done in 2016 recouped 64.9% of the cost, while those with minor kitchen remodels recouped as much as 83.1%.

According to the Remodeling Magazine, an example of a <a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/major-kitchen-remodel?y=2016">major kitchen remodel</a> will feature:
<ul>
 	<li>Updating an outdated 200-square-foot kitchen with a 30-linear-feet of semi-custom wood cabinetry and a 3-by-5-foot kitchen island, laminate countertops and standard double-tub stainless-steel sink with standard single-lever faucet;</li>
 	<li>Custom lighting and appliance upgrade, including a more sophisticated garbage disposal system;</li>
 	<li>New flooring;</li>
 	<li></li>
</ul>
You may not have to have all of the above done as part of your kitchen remodel, but you should plan in advance nevertheless.
<h2>Outdoor Kitchens</h2>
Even though La Jolla is blessed with warm weather year-round, some homeowners are still reluctant to move their kitchen outdoors. With modern outdoor fireplaces and ovens, cooking outdoors no longer has to be restricted to grilling. In addition to cooking outdoors, you can also maintain a pleasant outdoor temperature at all times with modern fire pits.

Having an outdoor kitchen also means that your home interior will be free from smells and the air will be significantly cooler indoors, just like you want it.

To make sure you can use your outdoor kitchen even when it’s raining, consider adding a roof as extra protection.
<h2>Deck Additions</h2>
It would be a real surprise if you didn’t have a deck already. However, if you don’t have it, now is as good a time as any to start planning to add one. A fully functional deck gives you more space for lounging. With a plethora of stylish seating and sofa sets, as well as accent furniture, rugs and accessories for outdoor patios and decks, it’s no wonder that more and more homeowners are adding a deck to their home.

Besides, a deck addition can enable you to recoup around 70% of the cost.

<h2>Sunroom Additions</h2>
While some people have no problem spending time outdoors, others suffer from allergies or are simply annoyed by all the insects buzzing around. Does that mean they don’t get to enjoy the beneficial Vitamin D-filled sunshine?

Absolutely not!

That’s where sunrooms come as a great alternative (or addition) to a deck or outdoor patio. With large windows, a sunroom addition will bring as much sunshine to your home as you like. For maximum efficiency and enjoyment, consider installing window films.
<h2>Second Story Additions</h2>
Although they are among the priciest home remodeling projects with the average cost of $171,056, second story additions can help you recoup as much as 69.3% of the cost, according to the 2016 Cost vs. Value Report by the Remodeling Magazine. The figure actually rose in comparison with the data from 2015.

There is hardly any doubt that major home remodeling projects, like second story additions, need careful planning. If you are planning on undertaking any of the projects we listed in the article, start planning today!
