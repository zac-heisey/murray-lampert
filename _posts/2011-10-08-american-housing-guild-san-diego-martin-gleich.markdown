I am dedicating this post to the memory of <a title="Martin Gleich" href="http://signonsandiego.com/news/2011/oct/07/martin-gleich-major-san-diego-home-builder-and-phi/">Martin "Marty" Gleich</a>, a San Diego icon who founded American Housing Guild and <a title="Guild Mortgage" href="http://guildmortgage.com/">Guild Mortgage</a>.  Mr. Gleich passed away on September 25, 2011 at the age of 87.

Besides being know as a home builder and mortgage broker, Mr. Gleich was a generous philanthropist, giving anonymously to many causes including education, libraries, the environment and the arts.

Mr. Gleich built over 20,000 homes in Serra Mesa, Mission Village, Clairemont, Grossmont and San Carlos from the early 1950's through the mid 1970's.  In the late 60's, a home remodeling division was started, and Murray Lampert was the general manager for many years before founding his own company, <a title="Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel San Diego" href="http://www.murraylampert.com/">Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel</a> in 1975.

In 1960, Mr. Gleich started Guild Mortgage to help people finance there homes.  <a title="Guild Mortgage Company" href="http://guildmortgage.com">Guild Mortgage</a> is still doing business today.

To this day, when you walk the streets of Serra Mesa - Mission Village, you will see the American Housing Guild logos stamped in driveways.  American Housing Guild homes were distinct with pitched ceilings inside, and siding on the exterior.

Martin Gleich will be remembered for how passionate he was about improving the lives of others and helping to make the world a better place.
