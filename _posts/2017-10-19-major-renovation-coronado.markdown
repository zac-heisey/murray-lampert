The owner of this beautiful Coronado home is a retired Navy captain and son of a brick mason. This inspired the blue accent colors throughout the home as well as the brick-red front door.

This [whole home remoodel project in Coronado](/featured-projects/621-i-ave-coronado/) involved a ton of moving pieces. The project required architectural design, interior design, sourcing of finishes, structural engineering, permit processing and construction. We basically gutted the interior in remodeled the majority of the home.

**Special project highlights include:**

We built a new kitchen with custom white cabinetry, quartz counters, full height subway tile back-splash, new stainless steel appliances and sink. We love the timelessness and bright energy of fresh white kitchens!

We added stair treads and replaced handrail caps with stained wood to match the flooring perfectly. We installed new white painted stair risers and installed railing spindles and posts.

In the family room, the existing fireplace was refaced with red brick. We designed and installed white custom entertainment cabinetry as well.

Bathrooms were remodeled and updated with white [custom cabinets](/san-diego-custom-cabinet-construction-services), quartz counters, sparkling new plumbing fixtures, white subway tiles with recessed niches, and a shower seat (great safety feature!).

We added LED recessed light fixtures, wall sconces, pendent lights and other decorative fixtures throughout the home.

When the renovation was over, it was amazing to see the reaction from the clients. A lot of time, patience and hard work goes into projects like these and weâ€™re always thrilled to see the smiles once everything is complete.
