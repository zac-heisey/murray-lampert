, one of the most frequently asked questions we are asked is, "how long will my home remodeling project take?"

We are known for being a Timely San Diego Home Remodeling contractor, and have a track record for finishing our projects ahead of schedule.
<h2>Why are we different than most home remodeling contractors?</h2>
1.  We create a detailed scope of work so the homeowner and our craftspeople know exactly what to expect.

2.  Comprehensive architectural plans are drafted.  The municipalities are familiar with our building documents, which streamlines the permit processing.

3.  The same trades and vendors are used on every on of our projects.  This eliminates time loss due to bidding, everyone works together as a team, and the construction/remodeling is done right the first time.

4.  Company trained project managers are assigned to each and every project.  These managers are responsible for scheduling trades, ordering materials, meeting inspectors, interfacing with homeowners, and maintaining quality control.

5.  Field conditions are handled swiftly because our project managers and company employed architect are in the same office.  Most required changes are handled the same day.

For over 35 years we have built our reputation for Timely San Diego Home Remodeling.
