The holiday season is arguably the busiest time of year. But despite how hectic it may feel, nothing is better than slowing down at the end of the year to spend quality time with your loved ones. We are a huge fan of entertaining, and love nothing more than to have our home filled with family and friends to spread that holiday cheer.

Yet, with everything that comes along with hosting (planning, decorating, shopping, prepping, cleaning)  - it is impossible to find the time to cook. Luckily, traditional holiday meals are no longer required when hosting...  seriously!

Appetizers are a fun and easy way to feed your hungry guests while spending half the amount of time in the kitchen...and they won't even know the difference! We promise, a spread of fun and easy appetizers will impress your guests and keep them interacting and enjoying festivities all night long.

Here are some of our favorite holiday bites that can prepared in minutes!
