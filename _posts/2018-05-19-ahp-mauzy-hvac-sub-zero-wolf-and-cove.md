Summer is nearly here and the temperature is steadily climbing. On the latest [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/the-approved-home-pro-radio-show-mauzy-heating-air-sub-zero-wolf-cove/), Cody Mauzy from [Mauzy Heating, Air & Solar](https://www.mauzy.com/) gives his recommendations for keeping your AC system going strong from Memorial Day through Labor Day. We also chat about the full line of kitchen appliance products from [Sub-Zero, Wolf, and Cove](http://www.subzero-wolf.com/).

Finally, in this week's Cantor's Corner segment, we discuss some of the requirements of remodeling a historical (45+ years old) home in San Diego. It's important to get prior approval before doing any remodeling work on a historical home, as well as explore options for earning historical designation or becoming eligible for the [Mills Act](https://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/historical/faq/millsact), which can save you up to 70% on property taxes for life.
