As the holiday season comes knocking, you are likely getting your shopping lists and holiday cards ready to go. But have you given any thought to your how your home will fare during the most wonderful time of the year? Here are a few suggestions for getting your home in holiday mode:

<strong>Freshen up outside.</strong> If you plan to have some outdoor decorations on your property, why not do a few curb-appeal improvements while you’re at it? Trim shrubs and hedges, sweep debris, rake leaves, and take care of any maintenance issues, like broken fence slats or damaged garage doors. If you plan to shed light (literally) on your home this holiday season, make sure your curb appeal passes the test first.

<strong>Clean out the fridge and cupboards.</strong> The holiday season comes with its share of excess, especially when it comes to food. Go through the food in your fridge, including condiments that may have expired, and get rid of anything outdated. Do the same for your cupboards and keep in mind that many local organizations hold food drives during this season. Fill a few bags with non-perishable items and clear out some space in your cupboards at the same time.

<strong>Schedule minor renovations.</strong> Most people wait for the warm-weather months to schedule any <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/remodel/">home remodeling</a>or construction. In truth, the winter months are a great time for indoor repairs or changes. Many residential construction companies are slow during the holiday season, meaning your project will potentially receive more attention and be finished more quickly. Decide what small renovation projects you'd really like to complete before the end of the year and schedule them before you start hanging your holly.

<strong>Donate and organize toys.</strong> No matter how much you try to scale back on materialism during the holidays, your kids will still end up with a lot more stuff by the end of the season. Between school parties, neighborhood get-togethers, and all the unwrapping of gifts through Hanukkah or on Christmas morning—new toys will seem to multiply exponentially in your home. Make space in advance for all the new items by purging old or unwanted toys and clothing. Find a local church or charity that’s accepting gently-used items for children who need them and donate your over-abundance.

<strong>Draft a plan.</strong> Before you start haphazardly throwing ornaments on your tree or stringing lights across your front porch, sit down with a sketchbook. Take inventory of the decorations you already own and decide what you might want to purchase or even create to make your home look its best. Consider storage upfront too. When you buy a new wreath or lights, pick up a plastic bin for storage when the season comes to a close. In 2012, the average American family spent around $52 on holiday season decorations—it’s a great idea to make those investments last longer. It will make taking down decorations at the end of the season less of a chore to boot.

The holidays provide a perfect opportunity for positive upgrades to your home that you may have put off during the year. Let your home shine from Thanksgiving through the New Year with a little bit of preparation and elbow grease.
