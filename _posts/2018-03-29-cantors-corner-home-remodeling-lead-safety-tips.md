Earlier this week, [ABC 10 News reported](https://www.10news.com/news/protecting-san-diegans-from-hazardous-material-in-home-renovation) on recent [crackdowns by the Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/u-s-epa-settlement-helps-protect-san-diego-residents-lead-paint-health-hazards) on six contracting and home remodeling companies who had violated lead paint and asbestos regulations. Those six companies, operating in California and Arizona, were forced to pay a combined $287,000 in penalties.

The report highlighted a local San Diego contractor, **Renovation Realty**, who was required to pay a settlement of over $41,000 for renovation work performed in San Diego and Santee "without being EPA-certified to perform work in pre-1978 housing where lead-based paint is assumed to be present."

As outlined in this edition of Cantor's Corner, California law requires lead-safe practices on any structure built before 1978. If your home was built prior to 1978, any contractor or home improvement professional you work with will be required to arrange testing of any project areas by an independently licensed hygienist.

Proof of proper removal and disposal of any lead-containing materials will need to take place _before_ your remodeling project can get started. If your contractor suggests otherwise, or isn't aware of the EPA regulations, that should be a huge red flag. Even well-known companies that we compete against cut corners. If you are remodeling, I recommend downloading the Lead Safe pamphlet that can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/lead/lead-safe-certified-guide-renovate-right
