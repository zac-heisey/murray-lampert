Did you know that you can actually <a href="http://murraylampert.com/what-home-improvements-are-tax-deductible">save money through various rebates</a> for energy-efficient products and appliances for your home? By purchasing and installing not only energy but also water-efficient products and appliances, you will <strong>pay less, have more money at the end of the month, enhance the value of your property and most importantly – have a healthier living environment.</strong>

San Diego homeowners who are planning a home improvement project by the end of 2016 should definitely consider these rebate opportunities. Moreover, they should consult a reliable remodeling company in San Diego to see how these rebates might influence their upcoming home improvement project. Projects such as bathroom or <a href="http://murraylampert.com/2016-eco-friendly-kitchen-remodeling-ideas/">kitchen remodeling</a> are proven to boost the resale value of a home, especially if they include energy-saving fixtures and fittings.
<h3>How Do Rebates Work?</h3>
Put simply, rebate programs offer <strong>discounts on certain products</strong>, and the rebate amount can be subtracted from the full price when you make the purchase, or you can initially pay the full price, and then submit your rebate claim to receive the <strong>cash-back</strong> rebate.

Rebate programs in California mostly include energy and water-efficient residential products and appliances. They serve as an incentive for homeowners to upgrade their existing appliances, get a more energy-efficient, sustainable home with an enhanced resale value and save money in the long run.
<h3>How to Find Rebates in San Diego?</h3>
The City of San Diego offers a number of rebate programs, a couple of which we’ll present in this article. To stay updated about new rebate opportunities in San Diego, bookmark the <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/water/conservation/rebates">official rebates page</a>.

Products and appliances with the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/rebate-finder">Energy Star label also qualify for rebates</a>, and we’ll present some that are offered in your area.

You’d better hurry up, though. Otherwise, you might miss out on some excellent rebate opportunities for 2016.
<h3>Rain Barrel Rebate</h3>
This particular rebate can earn you as much as $1 per gallon of barrel storage capacity and the maximum of $400 dollars per household. This incentive is aimed at conserving water in a quick and efficient way – through residential rainwater harvesting.

You can receive the rain barrel rebate amount when you purchase and install a rain barrel. Since the rain barrel has to be connected to the home's rain gutter downspout, your rooftops have to have gutters and downspouts for you to be able to qualify for this rebate. Also, don’t forget to take the pre-installation photos, because they will be taken into account when you file out a claim for the cash-back rebate.
<h3>Graywater Systems Rebate Program</h3>
This rebate program is a stimulus to homeowners to conserve water by reusing it. A typical California home generates as much as 60,000 gallons of graywater every year, of which the staggering 22,000 gallons can be reused.

Many people are still unwilling to embrace the concept of reused water because they feel it’s not completely clean. What they might not know is that <strong>graywater doesn’t include water from toilets</strong>, or kitchen sinks or dishwashers, for that matter. Additionally, while graywater is untreated wastewater, a graywater system entails wastewater treatment.
<h3>Look Out for These Rebates in 2017</h3>
The City of San Diego also offers Grass Replacement and Micro-Irrigation, but applications for 2016 are already over. The former provides cash-back rebates for water-wise plant material used to replace grass from the lawns, while the latter is concerned with transforming the overhead spray sprinkler system into low-application rate micro-irrigation.

<h3>Other Rebates in San Diego</h3>

Additionally, <strong>SoCal Water$mart </strong>provides indoor and outdoor rebates, including high-efficiency water toilets, clothes washers<strong>,</strong> soil moisture sensor systems and also – rain barrels.
