<div class="MsoNormal">For those of you who have never remodeled, it can be a challenging and trying experience if you choose the wrong company.  For those of you who have remodeled, I am sure you learned some valuable lessons that will help you the next time around.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">As a contractor, one of the biggest mistakes I see homeowners making is accepting proposals from too many companies.  Frankly, there are only a handful of reputable firm to choose from.  It becomes very difficult to keep track of details and conversation when there are too many companies involved.  My suggestion is to conduct brief (one hour or less) interviews with the companies you are considering, and choose the company/companies that win your confidence.</div>
