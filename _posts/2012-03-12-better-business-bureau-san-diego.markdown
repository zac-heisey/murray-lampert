In this challenging economic time we continue to follow our business model of "Truth In Home Remodeling".  That means detailed Architectural plans, comprehensive all inclusive project specifications, high quality materials, skilled craftspeople, and the best warranty in the business.

The formula for customer satisfaction is easy, listen to you your clients needs, deliver projects within budget, and finish on time.  <a href="http://www.guildquality.com/cr/Murray-Lampert-Construction/3M354011520469D/">Our approval rating</a> is the report card that backs it all up.
