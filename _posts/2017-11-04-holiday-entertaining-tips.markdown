Let's face it, we all want the holidays to be merry and stress-free. The season should be spent fully absorbing holiday cheer with your loved ones, not rushed or stressed. Use these tips to get the most out of your holiday entertaining without having to deal with the pressure of holiday perfection.

**1. PART WITH PERFECTION**

Prioritize. What is it that you *absolutely* need to make your gathering go smoothly? Make a list and put the basic, most important duties at the top. That way if you don’t have time to complete everything you hoped for, you only risk cutting out the small things. You can strive to complete everything on your list, but don’t be disappointed if you miss a few of the details – chances are your guests won’t even notice!

**2. EARLY PREP**

Perhaps the most effective way to eliminate stress on the big day of entertaining is to do everything possible before the holiday get-together. Get the house clean & ready. Prep any décor and accommodations, such as seating, and prep all of the food as much as possible. Early preparation will allow you to have time to work with any unexpected events that may occur. The day of the party should be spent doing as little prep as possible so you can focus on what is truly important – celebrating the season with those you love!

**3. RECRUIT**

Party planning does not have to be a one-man job. Delegate positions around your household. You shouldn’t feel like you must prepare completely on your own. Don’t feel guilty assigning roles to your kids or spouse. The extra hands may be needed in cleaning up the yard or even planning entertainment. It is also worth considering hiring a cleaner for before and after the event. It is also appropriate to request your guests to bring something to contribute, whether it be food, spirits, or games!

**4. REVAMP THE MENU**

Rather than spending time on a full-course meal, consider buying cocktail foods or desserts. Food bars have become increasingly popular among party hosts. We love the idea of a hot cocoa bar, baked potato bar, or even a taco bar. The possibilities are endless!! Put the store-bought food on beautiful dinnerware to give the presentation a facelift. You can also adorn your store-bought food by decorating with nutmeg or sprigs of pine. We also love the idea of a homemade holiday cocktail – Eggnog and sangria are among the countless options. It may even be worthwhile to find a caterer if your budget is flexible and time is of essence.

**5. MAKE IT MEMORABLE**

There are a handful of ways you can make your get-together stand out. First, you can set up a classic board games corner. Nothing is more nostalgic than getting the group together for some fun, light-hearted competition over Monopoly, Clue, or Battleship. Second, you can consider making or buying a backdrop for a DIY photo booth. This is a surefire way to entertain your guests by spending very little. Use wrapping paper, bows, tinsel, balloons, ornaments, snowflakes, and props to create a fun booth. Finally, let yourself relax and enjoy the moment!
