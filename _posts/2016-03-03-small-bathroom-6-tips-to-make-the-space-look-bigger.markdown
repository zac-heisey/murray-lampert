You see your bathroom as a sanctuary-a place you can retreat to after a long day at work. Or perhaps you
and your children use the space as a room of adventure. Whatever the case, you expect your bathroom to be
large enough to accommodate your needs.

But if your bathroom is smaller than you need or would like it to be, you may find it hard to enjoy the
space. Whether you can afford to remodel your bathroom entirely or you only have the finances for a few
touch-ups, you can do a few things to make your bathroom look much bigger. Read on to discover how you can do
so.

<strong>1. Keep the Counters Free of Clutter</strong>

If you look around your home, do you see piles of clothing, toys, or other clutter? Does the space seem
cramped and tight? When your possessions build up and clutter an area, the piles make the area look much
smaller. This principle also applies to your bathroom area.

However, in a smaller bathroom, clutter can make the space seem incredibly packed and tiny in size. To
give the illusion of larger space, keep the counters and open surfaces clear of clutter. Store items inside
cabinets or in decorative storage baskets to make your bathroom look more organized.

<strong>2. Recess Cabinets and Eliminate Bulky Shelves</strong>

If you do choose to store your bathroom items inside cabinets, make sure to avoid dark, bulky cabinets and
shelves. The dark colors and bulky frames make your space seem smaller. Instead, install recessed cabinets.
These structures rest inside your walls and provide you with ample storage space-all while keeping smooth
lines across your bathroom walls.

You can also open up the space at the bottom of lower cabinets to expose the floor underneath. This method
further opens up the space, making your bathroom look larger than it actually is. If you prefer, you can also
use floating furniture to create a similar effect.

<strong>3. Blend Colors on the Walls, Ceiling, and Floor</strong>

The more uniform in color your bathroom appears, the easier it is for the eye to move around the space. As
you blend the colors of your walls, floor, and ceiling, you create a smooth, unbroken line for the eye to
travel across. This line creates the illusion of a larger space.

Paint your walls and ceilings the same color. For the floor, you can use accent rugs that complement the
paint on the walls. For the walls in your shower, however, consider installing colored tile. The tile
separates the shower from the rest of the space. But if you choose a tile that matches the color of your
walls, you only enhance the optical illusion of a larger space.

Make sure if you use tile to run the material all the way up to the ceiling. This technique will draw the
eye upward and enhance the space. Also make sure to use bigger tiles rather than smaller ones. Smaller tiles
incorporate more grout lines into the structure, which in turn break up the overall look and unity of the
wall. Using larger tiles creates a long line the eye needs to move naturally through the space.

<strong>4. Install a Glass Shower Enclosure</strong>

Another way to enhance your bathroom space is to install a clear, glass enclosure around your shower. The
glass further opens up the area, making it seem larger. If you can afford a more substantial remodel, replace
your tub with a full-length shower.

<strong>5. Increase the Light</strong>

The more light a space has, the brighter and larger it appears. If you don't have windows in your
bathroom, add a small one to an exterior wall. You can also redo the lighting in the space if you'd like.
Consider installing track lighting above the mirror or placing sconces across the walls.

If possible, add a few mirrors along the walls as well. Install a wall-to-wall mirror above the sink, and
place a couple of accent mirrors throughout the rest of the bathroom. The light that flows into the space
will reflect off the mirrors, making the area seem much larger.

<strong>6. Add Simple Window Treatments</strong>

Finally, use simple window treatments in your bathroom. Choose light-colored, short curtains. If you
prefer to add a little variety with the curtains, select a fabric that has a small pattern on it. For the
hardware, install something that matches the overall color scheme of the space. Remember to stick with
lighter colors and materials since they reflect light more.
