Cold weather is coming, and with it the desire to huddle up indoors. Resist the temptation to spend all winter inside by making the right adjustments to your [outdoor living spaces](/san-diego-outdoor-living-space-design). These tips 7 can help make your backyard cozy and warm in spite of the frigid temperatures.

## Here are 7 ways to make the most of your outdoor space this winter.

**1. Find Several Heat Sources**

One way to bring warmth onto your cold patio is to install heat sources from every angle. Radiant heating is a great option to warm up your concrete or stone floors, and space heaters can help you and your guests feel surrounded by warmth. You might even install elevated heat lamps to save some patio space while directing heat downward.

**2. Light Fires**

A fire gives off a tremendous amount of heat, but it’s important that you implement it safely. A fireplace adds a touch of style and creates the feeling of an outdoor living room. Candles exude subtle warmth while serving as decorative accessories. Finally, a fire pit can become the focal point of all outdoor living areas. Fire pits are not only great for warmth; they’re also fun for campfire activities such as toasting marshmallows or cooking hot dogs. 

**3. Cook Outdoors**

Outdoor cooking isn’t just for summer. You can outfit your patio with an entire outdoor kitchen that makes entertaining during the winter fun and easy. The equipment will become warm as the food cooks, radiating heat outward to provide some cozy comfort. You can prepare lots of winter-appropriate meals, such as slow-cooked meats or grilled autumn vegetables. Start small with just a grill or go big with a mixture of other appliances: 

- Grills
- Smokers
- Pizza ovens
- Fryers
- Stovetops

You can also create a true kitchen area by adding prep space, storage and a sink. You’ll be able to make use of this no matter what the temperature is.

**4. Implement Lighting**

The winter months aren’t just about cooler temperatures. The sun will go down much earlier, and you’ll need sufficient lighting on your patio to make the space inviting and practical. Overhead lighting is great for covered patios, but you can still illuminate your outdoor living space without a roof. Use sconces on the side of your home or ground lighting embedded in your stone or decking. Stand-up lanterns can also get the job done if necessary. 

**5. Use the Right Furniture**

If your patio isn’t covered, you need to consider whether or not your outdoor furniture is able to withstand the moisture and low temperatures that come along with winter. Metal furniture will rust easily if it gets wet, while freezing conditions can cause plastic to break. Wood is the most durable material you can use, but you still need to think about your cushion fabrics. If they’re not resistant to moisture, they can develop mold after several storms. Many of these problems can be solved by properly insulating your patio, or at the very least, adding a covering to protect furniture from rain. 

Once your patio is covered, you have many more options in regard to furniture. You can choose cozy, plush fabrics in warm tones of orange, red or brown. Consider investing in a basket where you can store blankets for your guests to snuggle up with. 

**6. Add Roof Coverage**

A permanent or retractable roof over your patio or deck provides many benefits. During the colder months, you can sit outside and watch bad weather pass by, and you won’t have to clean off your furniture or your grill once it does. With a permanent roof, you can install lighting for additional ambience and warmth, and there’s no need to monitor the weather to make sure your patio is protected. However, a retractable roof allows you to take full advantage of the bright winter sun on days when it emerges from the clouds. 

**7. Install a Hot Tub**

You may not have to pack away your bathing suits for the winter if you invest in a hot tub. On milder evenings, this provides you an opportunity to unwind and relax. Your guests will also enjoy the benefits of warming up in a hot bath under the stars. 

Combine two or more of these solutions to put together the winter patio of your dreams. Your outdoor living spaces can be warm and cozy this season with a little help from Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel. [Contact us today and schedule your free consultation](#quick-contact).
