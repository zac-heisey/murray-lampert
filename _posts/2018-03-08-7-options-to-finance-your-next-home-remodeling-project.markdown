When it comes to home remodeling, even small and medium sized DIY projects can grow to be very costly. If you’re considering a major renovation like a kitchen, bathroom upgrades or a home addition, you could be looking at an investment of $50,000\+. There are several options to carefully consider before you finance your next home remodeling project.

We’ve outlined the most popular options that homeowners consider before they begin a home renovation. It’s up to you to be cognizant of your unique financial situation and do what is best for you and your family. With any large investment, you should consider all outcomes and choose the direction that suits you best.

**Option 1: Use Cash**

As with most purchases, if you have cash, it can be preferred to avoid taking out a line of credit. However, it’s not as realistic for all homeowners to have the funds for a major kitchen renovation sitting around. In many cases, it could take years for you to save the amount of money you’d need for an extensive home renovation.

We recommend using cash if you have it, or even using partial cash to offset how much you’ll need to borrow. This is the safest option, but there are plenty more.

**Option 2: Consider Low Interest Credit Cards**

If you’re a homeowner, you’ve likely been teased with countless credit card offerings over your adult lifetime. If you're credit is healthy, there is nothing wrong with putting small and medium sized home renovation projects on a zero perfect interest or low interest credit card.

They key here is to obviously pay this off quickly, so we don't recommend putting a $20,000 project on a Visa. Honestly ask yourself, will I be able to pay this off before the credit card offer expires and I start to accrue interest? If you’re uncertain in any way, don’t do it.

But if you know you have great credit, and can pay off the balance in the right amount of time, we think this can be a great option for you.

**Option 3: Refinance Your Home**

If you’ve been in your home for quite some time, and your current interest rate is higher than the rates of the market, a refinance could be a great option for you. Refinancing will lower your interest rate and thus your monthly mortgage payment, giving you some financial wiggle room to make home improvements.

Consider this option carefully. When you refinance, you’re using your home as collateral against a larger loan. It’s only advised to make home improvements that will boost your home’s value.

**Option 4: Take Out a Personal Loan**

Personal loans have pros and cons. One large pro to personal loans is that they don’t require you to trade your home as collateral or use it’s equity to complete your dream renovation. Some cons to taking out a personal loan for a home improvement project is that the interest rates can be higher. You’ll also need excellent credit to be approved and personal loans need to be paid back, on average, within 5-7 years.

**Option 5: Apply for a Home Equity Line of Credit**

Also known as HELOC, a home equity line of credit uses the equity in your home to fund the project.

According to Nerd Wallet, “A home equity line of credit, so often referred to as a [HELOC](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/mortgages/home-equity-line-of-credit/), is a convenient way to draw on the value of your home — and tap the equity only as you need it. That’s a good thing, because your home’s long-term value can be a real wealth-building tool.”

If you do this the right way, the advantages can be plentiful. The key is to understand the best HELOC lenders available to you. Nerd Wallet helped us identify [HELOC lenders](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/mortgages/best-heloc-lenders/) that are worth considering.

**Option 6: Home Equity Loan**

A home equity loan is different from a HELOC. Home equity loans are essentially a second mortgage on your home. They typically have fixed interest rates and you can get access to the funds in one large sum. If you can manage the monthly payments, this can be a great option. Watch out for pricey transaction fees and closing costs - which can come as a surprise to those considering this option.

**Option 7: Reverse Mortgage**

For those of you 62 years of age or older, a reverse mortgage can be a great option. We’ve discussed aging in place renovations numerous times, and have helped several San Diego homeowners increase their safety and comfortability at home.

If you choose a reverse mortgage, it can be more expensive than a home loan or line of credit, but you don’t have to pay it back until you sell the home.
