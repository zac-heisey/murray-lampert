## 7 Home Remodels that Pay Off

**1) Replacing Your Garage Door**

Upgrading your original garage door to one with a bit more style can instantly boost your property's curb appeal. If you can add insulation to increase the door's energy-efficiency, that's sure to be attractive to potential buyers.

**2) Refreshing Bathrooms**

The [bathroom](/san-diego-bathroom-remodeling-services) is one of the most important rooms in any home. Improvements such as a sauna-style shower stall, dual vanities, and high-quality tile will make your bathroom seem that much more appealing. If it's been awhile since you changed the look of your bathroom, it's probably time to refresh any outdated styles and features.

**3) Remodeling the Kitchen**

Kitchens are a vital area to the overall feel of any home. Stainless steel appliances, [upgraded countertops](/the-most-popular-materials-for-kitchen-countertops/), and new cabinetry are just a few ways to create a fresh look to your kitchen _and_ add value to your home. Adding an island for more prep space and seating can also go a long way.

**4) Hardwood Floors**

Carpeting can become faded and dingy over time, which is why many homeowners switch to [hardwood flooring](/hardwood-flooring-2015-infographic/). In addition to their elegant and dignified appearance, hardwood floors are easier to clean and maintain.

**5) Replacing Windows**

New windows can have a big impact on your home's energy-efficiency, which is [upgrading windows](/efficiency-sound-insulation-curb-appeal-with-new-windows/) can lead to a substantial return on investment. Whether or not you plan on putting your home on the market in the near future, it's worth looking into replacing your old, drafty windows.

**6) Installing New Siding**

Not only does new siding enhance the look of your property, it can also lower your utility bills. The right siding can help insulate your home and reduce reliance on your HVAC system.

**7) Building a Deck or Patio**

More and more homeowners are beginning to see their backyard patios, [decks](/the-pros-guide-to-deck-restoration/), and other outdoor areas as extensions of their interior living spaces. Homes featuring customized, well-designed [outdoor living spaces](/san-diego-outdoor-living-space-design) are more desirable to both homeowners and potential buyers.
