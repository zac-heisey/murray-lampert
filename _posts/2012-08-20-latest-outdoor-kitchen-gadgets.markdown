<a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services/">Outdoor kitchens</a> used to be as simple as a barbecue grill and a picnic table, but they have grown to include built-in grills, side burners, warming drawers and fully-stocked bars. Nowadays with the latest gadgets, you can create an outdoor kitchen that is just as useful and technologically advanced as a professional indoor <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services/">kitchen</a>.

<strong>Infrared Grill</strong>

<a href="http://murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Firepit-La-Mesa.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1152" style="margin: 5px;" title="Firepit---La-Mesa" src="http://murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Firepit-La-Mesa-300x200.gif" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Infrared grills are becoming very popular among outdoor cooking enthusiasts. They heat up faster and can sustain much higher temperatures than traditional gas grills. Most infrared grills can heat up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as seven minutes. They are great for cooking meats because the high temperatures sear the outside of the meat, locking in flavorful juices. One disadvantage of using infrared technology for grilling is that it cooks so quickly that you have to be careful not to burn vegetables and other time-sensitive food items. Most modern infrared grills allow you to use both infrared and traditional gas for cooking so that you have more control over the cooking temperature of your food.

<strong>Grilling Baskets</strong>

Flexible, non-stick grilling baskets are a great way to cook food that is likely to fall through the grates of your barbecue. Double sided netting that is flexible allows you to turn everything in the basket at once, allowing it to cook more evenly. Most grill baskets are also dishwasher safe for easy cleanup. It’s a good idea to have several grill baskets so that you can fill as many as you need before you start grilling.

<strong>Himalayan Salt Plate</strong>

One of the main concerns that people have when they are cooking outdoors is that it can be difficult to cook food evenly. Placing your food on top of a Himalayan salt plate increases the flavor while allowing the food to cook evenly. These plates are great for cooking vegetables, fish, meat, and more.

<strong>Outdoor Ice Machine</strong>

Outdoor ice machines are one of the most convenient outdoor kitchen gadgets available. There are few things worse than running out of ice in the middle of a party in summer, so an ice maker is a beneficial appliance in any outdoor kitchen. Most outdoor ice makers only require you to place them and plug them in, they are very easy to install and may even have wheels so that you can move the unit easily. It is best to place your ice maker right next to your drinks so that it's convenient for party guests.

<strong>Popcorn Popper for the Grill</strong>

Most barbecue popcorn poppers have long, cool-grip handles so that you don't have to worry about burning yourself. They are easy to clean and great for entertaining children and adults, and also offer a yummy after-dinner snack. Most popcorn poppers for the grill have a mesh lid so that steam can escape easily without allowing the popcorn to escape, and the lid can also be used for a serving bowl. Pop plain popcorn and wow your guests by adding your own unique flavors—garlic cayenne, caramel with crunched-up bacon, chili lime, sugar and cinnamon, garlic salt and parmesan—the possibilities are endless.
The days of simple picnic tables and charcoal grills are gone. Today’s modern accessories have brought a whole new futuristic flair to the backyard barbecue.
