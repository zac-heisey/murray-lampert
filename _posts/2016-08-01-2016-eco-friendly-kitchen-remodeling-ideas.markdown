If you are like so many  home owners who wish to give their kitchen a design makeover, you might not even know where to begin. There seem to be [so many different trends](https://murraylampert.com/the-top-five-kitchen-cabinet-trends-that-will-rule-2017/) and you simply don’t know which one to go with.

Want to hear our solution? **[Go Green](/san-diego-green-home-construction)**.

If there is one trend that's here to stay, it’s definitely opting for the environmentally friendly design-build solutions including [sustainable kitchens](/building-ultimate-sustainable-kitchen). To illustrate the ways you can benefit from going green with your kitchen remodel, we share a handful of go-to eco-friendly ideas.

### Cork and Linoleum Flooring

Sure, traditional hardwood flooring can style up any kitchen, but maintaining it is hard work. On the other hand, tiled flooring involves a lot of grout, which means the presence of [harmful VOCs](https://www.h2obtech.com/grout-sealers/what-you-need-to-know-about-low-voc-content/). So is there middle ground? We say yes – cork and linoleum.

Cork is a smashing hit in the 2016 eco-friendly kitchen remodeling because it is fast-growing, meaning that it is a sustainable resource. More importantly, it’s ideal for people with allergies, because it’s resistant to dust and when installed properly – it is waterproof. Linoleum has an additional advantage – it doesn’t release toxic chemicals after being installed. What’s more, because it’s made from renewable materials, it is both eco-friendly and sustainable.

### Repurposed Wall Tiles

If you are tired of cookie-cutter kitchens, do something to make your kitchen stand out. There is hardly a better way than custom, repurposed wall tiles. In combination with [fully custom kitchen cabinets](/san-diego-custom-cabinet-construction-services), repurposed wall tiles with low-VOC grout will make a clear statement and offer a contemporary look to your [kitchen backsplash](/the-homeowners-guide-to-choosing-the-perfect-kitchen-backsplash/).

### Energy Star Kitchen Appliances

Eco hype started gathering momentum when more and more people began to realize how much energy and water they waste every day. Outdated appliances are among the largest offenders, but luckily, also the easiest to replace. [Energy Star](https://www.energystar.gov/) has become the gold standard for energy-saving appliances, ranging from refrigerators to ice makers. Although initially pricey, they provide significant savings in reduced utility bills each month.

### Energy Star-certified LEDs

Lighting solutions certified by Energy Star are ruling the era of "eco-enlightenment". Not only can they reduce your electricity bills, but also improve the functionality of your kitchen. Choose from a variety of Energy Star-certified [LED light bulbs](https://www.energystar.gov/products/lighting_fans/light_bulbs/learn_about_led_bulbs) and go for different light zones. You can set up task lights in the cooking area, while distributing accent and ambient lights across the kitchen to accentuate decorative elements. In addition, dimmer switches are ideal for creating the right mood.

### Energy-Efficient and Water-Purifying Fixtures

There are two compelling reasons why you should consider replacing timeworn fixtures: their energy-efficient counterparts can **reduce your water use up to 50 per cent** and give your **cleaner drinking water**. Tankless water heaters, low-flow faucets and water purifiers are just a couple of basic fixtures essential for an eco-friendly kitchen remodel. 2016 is seeing a major shift from the old-fashioned fixtures to sleek and modern ones, while the development of smarter kitchens is further propelled by the production of [automatic fixtures and appliances](/6-high-tech-gadgets-for-your-next-kitchen-remodel/).

### Salvaged Wood and Butcher Blocks

For a truly powerful impact on the environment, consider using salvaged or reclaimed wood for your kitchen cabinets, counter tops or the kitchen island. There are many companies who reclaim wood from old buildings, bridges or barns and thoroughly clean it so that it can be re-used. This philosophy is at the core of the eco movement, since reusing wood reduces deforestation.  Additionally, butcher blocks are composed of different pieces of reclaimed or repurposed wood that might have come from completely different places. Every piece is, therefore, unique and lends itself to an original kitchen makeover.

### Stainless Steel and Concrete

If you envision your dream kitchen in darker notes and with sharper edges, but you still want to keep it green, we have excellent news! Stainless steel is not only wildly popular but also eco-friendly, because 60 per cent of its content is recycled. On the other hand, concrete can also be an eco-trendy solution for your kitchen, as long as it is sourced locally.

### Recycled Cement, Glass and Paper

For a bold step into the era of eco-friendly design solutions, try out recycled materials like cement, glass, or even paper for your cabinets or countertops. Depending on the style and effect you wish to achieve, some of these creative solutions like [PaperStone](https://paperstoneproducts.net/wordpress/), or [Bio-Glass](https://www.houzz.com/bioglass-countertops) might be just the thing to make your kitchen remodel truly remarkable.
