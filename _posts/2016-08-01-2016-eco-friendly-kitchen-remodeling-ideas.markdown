If there is one trend that is here to stay, it’s definitely opting for the environmentally friendly design-build solutions and building a <a href="http://murraylampert.com/building-ultimate-sustainable-kitchen">sustainable kitchen</a>. To illustrate the ways you will benefit from going green, we present the hottest 2016 eco friendly kitchen remodeling ideas.
<h3>Cork and Linoleum Flooring</h3>
Traditional hardwood flooring can style up any kitchen, sure, but maintaining it is hard work. On the other hand, tiled flooring involves a lot of grout, which in turn means the presence of harmful VOCs. So is there middle ground? We say yes – cork and linoleum.

Cork is a smashing hit in the 2016 eco friendly kitchen remodeling because it is fast-growing, meaning that it is a sustainable resource. More importantly, it’s ideal for people with allergies, because it’s resistant to dust and when installed properly – it is waterproof. Linoleum has an additional advantage – it doesn’t release toxic chemicals after being installed. What’s more, because it’s made from renewable materials, it is both eco friendly and sustainable.
<h3>Repurposed wall tiles</h3>
If you are tired of cookie-cutter kitchens, do something to make your kitchen stand out. There is hardly a better way than custom repurposed wall tiles. In combination with <a href="http://murraylampert.com/san-diego-custom-cabinet-construction-services/">fully custom kitchen cabinets</a>, repurposed wall tiles with low-VOC grout will make a clear statement about contemporary kitchen <a href="http://murraylampert.com/the-homeowners-guide-to-choosing-the-perfect-kitchen-backsplash/">backsplash design</a>.
<h3>Energy Star Kitchen Appliances</h3>
Eco hype started gathering momentum when more and more people began to realize how much energy and water they waste every day. Outdated appliances are among the first to blame, but luckily – the easiest to replace. <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/">Energy Star</a> has become the golden standard for energy-saving appliances, ranging from refrigerators to ice makers. Although initially pricey, they significantly reduce electricity bills every month.
<h3>Energy Star-certified LEDs</h3>
Lighting solutions certified by Energy Star are ruling the era of eco-enlightenment. Not only can they reduce your electricity bills, but also improve the functionality of your kitchen. Choose from a variety of Energy Star-certified <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/lighting_fans/light_bulbs/learn_about_led_bulbs">LED light bulbs</a> and go for different light zones. You can set up task lights in the cooking area, while distributing accent and ambient lights across the kitchen to accentuate decorative elements. In addition, dimmer switches are ideal for creating the right mood.
<h3>Energy-Efficient and Water-Purifying Fixtures</h3>
There are two compelling reasons why you should consider replacing timeworn fixtures: their energy-efficient counterparts can <strong>reduce your water use up to 50 per cent</strong> and give your <strong>cleaner drinking water</strong>. Tankless water heaters, low-flow faucets and water purifiers are just a couple of basic fixtures essential for an eco friendly kitchen remodel. 2016 is seeing a major shift from the old-fashioned fixtures to sleek and modern ones, while the development of smarter kitchens is further propelled by the production of <a href="http://murraylampert.com/6-high-tech-gadgets-for-your-next-kitchen-remodel/">automatic fixtures and appliances</a>.
<h3>Salvaged Wood and Butcher Blocks</h3>
For a truly powerful impact on the environment, consider using salvaged or reclaimed wood for your kitchen cabinets, counter tops or the kitchen island. There are many companies who reclaim wood from old buildings, bridges or barns and thoroughly clean it so that it can be re-used. This philosophy is at the core of the eco movement, since reusing wood reduces deforestation.  Additionally, butcher blocks are composed of different pieces of reclaimed or repurposed wood that might have come from completely different places. Every piece is, therefore, unique and lends itself to an original <a href="http://murraylampert.com/remodel-your-kitchen-with-these-6-must-have-features-2/">kitchen design makeover</a>.
<h3>Stainless Steel and Concrete</h3>
If you envision your dream kitchen in darker notes and with sharper edges, but you still want to keep it green, we have excellent news! Stainless steel is not only wildly popular but also eco friendly, because 60 per cent of its content is recycled. On the other hand, concrete can also be an eco-trendy solution for your kitchen, as long as it is sourced locally.
<h3>Recycled Cement, Glass and Paper</h3>
For a bold step into the era of eco friendly design solutions, try out recycled materials like recycled cement, glass (even paper!) for your cabinets or countertops. Depending on the style and effect you wish to achieve, some of these creative solutions like paperstone, bio-glass or Squeak Mountain stone might be just the thing for you!
