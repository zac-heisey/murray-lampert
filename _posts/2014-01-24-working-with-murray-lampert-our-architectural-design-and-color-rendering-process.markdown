A critical part of any home remodeling or construction project is the design development process. Keep reading to learn more about the design development phase you will experience by working with Murray Lampert Design, Build, and Remodel.

<strong>Step 1: Gain a good understanding of the client’s needs and goals.<img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.murraylampert.com/wp-content/gallery/architectural-design/design1_page_3.png" width="336" height="224" /></strong>

At our firm, the process begins with a meeting between the client, our design specialist, and staff architect. After we listen to our client’s lifestyle, space, and budget goals, the preliminary design is developed.

<strong>Step 2: Develop preliminary design schemes.</strong>

Our staff architect produces a few different <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-home-design-services/">design </a>schemes based on what we discover in the meeting with the client.

<strong>Step 3: Help the client visualize their soon-to-be new space.</strong>

We share the preliminary designs and discuss the costs associated with each with the client. The client sees floor plans, elevations, 3D color renderings, and sometimes even a virtual walk-through. Renderings and elevations help the homeowner to visualize the new and remodeled spaces.

<strong>Step 4: Hash out the final design.</strong>

After more communication with our client, the final design is created. It is not uncommon for elements from all the schemes to come together in the finished project. The homeowner reviews this final design to visualize their new space and ensure the project meets their design and budget expectations. Then it’s time to get started!

<strong>Why Do We Have This Process?</strong>

The beauty of design development is that different design schemes and project scopes are identified. Adjustments in the design or scope can be made early on, which sets the stage for a successful relationship and rewarding experience.
With thorough planning and detailed designs, your home remodeling will be a successful and rewarding experience.
