Selywn Goldsmith, the author of <em>Designing for the Disabled</em> (1963), pioneered free access for disabled people and is credited with the creation of the dropped curb (now a standard). Many of his ideas were based upon the seven principles of universal design, an architectural movement coined by Robert L. Mace that emphasizes:
<ul>
	<li>Equitable use</li>
	<li>Flexibility in use</li>
	<li>Simple and intuitive</li>
	<li>Perceptible information</li>
	<li>Tolerance for error</li>
	<li>Low physical effort</li>
	<li>Size and space for approach and use</li>
</ul>

**Below are 15 ways that modern homes can implement universal design principles to increase accessibility and comfort for residents with and without disabilities:**

<ol>
	<li>Smooth ground-level entrances without stairs.</li>
	<li>Lever handles for opening doors rather than twisting knobs.</li>
	<li>Surfaces that are stable, firm, and slip resistant to prevent falls.</li>
	<li>Single-hand operation with closed fist for operable components including fire alarm pull stations.</li>
	<li>Wide interior doors, hallways, and alcoves with 60" x 60" turning space at doors and dead ends.</li>
	<li>Light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches.</li>
	<li>Buttons and other controls that can be distinguished by touch.</li>
	<li>Bright and appropriate lighting -- particularly task lighting.</li>
	<li>Text captioned telephones and televisions for auditory impairments.</li>
	<li>Use of meaningful icons with text labels.</li>
	<li>Displays with light-on-dark visual contrast.</li>
	<li>Avoid clutter for easier navigation throughout the home.</li>
	<li>Labels on equipment control buttons that is large print.</li>
	<li>Automated doors that feature a "push" option if heavier than five pounds.</li>
	<li>Ramp access in swimming pools.</li>
</ol>
