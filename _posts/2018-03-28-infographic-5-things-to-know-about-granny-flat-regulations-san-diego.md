The popularity of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) - also known as "granny flats" or "in-law suites" - continues to grow in California. The state saw a **63% increase in approved ADU construction permits in 2017** compared to 2016.

In San Diego, that [increase jumps to 71%](https://www.10news.com/news/california-sees-rise-in-granny-flat-construction), mainly due to recently loosened regulations and a simplified permitting process for qualified homeowners. In the animated infographic below, we break down 5 important things that homeowners should know about the recent changes to state and city regulations for ADUs before starting construction on their new [San Diego granny flat](/san-diego-in-law-suites).

### 5 Things to Know About Granny Flat Regulations in San Diego

1. **Bigger is Better** - San Diego expanded the maximum size of a granny flat from 700 sq.ft. to 50% of the primary residence’s size, or 1,200 sq.ft, whichever is less.

2. **City-backed Resources** - San Diego city officials are creating step-by-step manuals, along with a set of pre-approved granny flat designs, to help accelerate construction.

3. **Encinitas Leading the Way** - Homeowners in Encinitas can build granny flats up to 1,200 sq.ft. and are eligible to save around $3,500 in waived fees.

4. **Vacation Rentals a No-Go** - City regulations stipulate that lease agreements for granny flats must be no less than 30 days. This discourages homeowners from building a granny flat as a vacation rental.

5. **Fees Range Significantly** - Depending where you live and the type of granny flat you’re looking to build, fees to get started could range from $4,800 to $80,000+. Check with your local city council before you get started.
