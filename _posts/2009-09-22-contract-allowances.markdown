<div>A home improvement contract or scope of work document frequently has allowances called out for finishes and fixtures to be chosen by owner. I suggest doing your homework, and shopping up front to ensure that the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">contractor</span> isn't low balling these allowances.</div>
<div>A competent remodeling firm will provide you with a shopping list, and locations of their approved vendor showrooms. Making your selections up front will help insure that items will arrive timely, so completion is not delayed.</div>
<div>Here are some of the typical allowance items: Finished Flooring, Ceramic Tile/Natural Stone Materials, Granite Slab, Entry Doors, Door Hardware, Wood Windows, Specialty Cabinets, Plumbing Fixtures, Light Fixtures and Appliances. To see some design options, please visit <a href="http://www.standardsofexcellence.com/brandsbycategory_sc.php">http://www.standardsofexcellence.com/brandsbycategory_sc.php</a></div>
<div>Before signing a contract, make sure you are covered.</div>
