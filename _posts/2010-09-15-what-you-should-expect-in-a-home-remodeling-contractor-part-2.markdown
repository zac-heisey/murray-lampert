<strong>Honesty.</strong>  An honest home remodeler is one who admits when he doesn’t have an answer to your questions and does the research.  It is important that you trust your builder and feel confident that he is detail oriented.  Everything should be clearly written and thoroughly understood up front.

<strong>Value.</strong> 

A reputable contractor adds value by doing extra things on the job over and above the scope.  It may be an upgrade or additional work to make the project better without charging the homeowner.

<strong>Options.</strong>  A competent contractor will provide options and costs if there are different ways of accomplishing your improvements.  He or she will also give you honest opinions when asked.
