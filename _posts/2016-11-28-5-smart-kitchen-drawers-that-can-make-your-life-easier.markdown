Are you tired of the constant mess in your kitchen? It seems that no matter how tidy you are, cutlery, saucepans and other utensils simply get misplaced, cups get chipped and knives turn blunt. Maybe the time has come to seek some help from the outside. That is why we wanted to update you on some incredibly practical innovations you could consider for your next kitchen remodeling in San Diego.
<h3>Cup/Glass Drawers</h3>
Instead of keeping all the cups and glasses in the overhead cabinet, move them to a drawer in the lower cabinet. You will be able to reach all the pieces that somehow always end up at the back of the cabinet where you can’t see it. This way, you will have a clear overview of all the cups and glasses and keep it neat.

Just remember to store the cups and glasses upside down on a non-slip rubber liner, and make the drawer 7-8 inches high. This will protect the rims and keep the glasses from breaking. If you consider <a href="http://murraylampert.com/san-diego-custom-cabinet-construction-services/">having custom cabinets built</a>, this is definitely a feature to include.
<h3>Deep Drawers for Saucepans and Their Lids</h3>
It’s amazing how much time, space and energy you can save simply by having a deep bottom drawer with rear or side dividers, so that all the pots and pans can be stored comfortably together with their lids. Forget about stacking pots and pans one on top of another once and for all!

What’s more, think about all the plastic containers that somehow always get separated from their lids. Not only is this annoying, but completely unnecessary. Consider having one of these drawers built inside the lower kitchen cabinet and save yourself a remarkable amount of time!


<h3>Clear-Cut Cutlery Drawers</h3>
There is nothing quite as irritating as the sight of a messy cutlery drawer, with the forks, knives, and spoons all crammed together. Besides, whenever you reach to grab a piece of cutlery, you are basically in the dark – it surely aggravates me to always reach for a fork and end up with a spoon. Instead, install a shallow drawer with knife cavities and horizontal slots for other cutlery. The knives will stay sharp and you will avoid getting your fingers cut.
<h3>Pullout Chopping Boards</h3>
Why waste space on the countertop? You can have a pullout chopping board conveniently stored inside a lower cabinet drawer. Just make sure to adjust the height to be as leveled with the countertop as possible, so you don’t have to slouch while chopping.
<h3>Toe-Kick Drawers</h3>
You can have the kick &amp; open mechanism installed for your bottom drawers, so you don’t have to slouch every time you need to reach for a towel, cookbooks, saucepans, or anything else you prefer to keep in the bottom drawers. Keep the drawer pulls simple; otherwise, you might accidentally kick them.
<h3>Custom Cabinetry: The Future of Kitchen Remodeling in San Diego</h3>
