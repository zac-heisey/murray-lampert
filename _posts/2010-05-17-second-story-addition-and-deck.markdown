Meet Bill and Jill who are now enjoying their Second Story room and deck.  From design through construction and unltimatly completion, they thought everybody at MLC handled all aspects of the job very well.   They were very pleased, in fact said they plan on calling us back to discuss their next phase in the long range plan, and that is to add a master bedroom on top of existing single story house.   Thank you Bill and Jill for choosing Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel to improve your home.
