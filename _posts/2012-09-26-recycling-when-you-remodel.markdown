I was interviewed today by Mark Newman, Senior Editor at <a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/green-policy/trash-talk.aspx">Remodeling Magazine</a> about our recycling program.  The article will be featured in the November 2012 issue of Remodeling Magazine.

<strong>Here is how we implemented our system, Recycling When You Remodel: </strong>
Our design representatives, project managers and crews were educated on recycling and we all agreed to follow a system on all our projects.

The Recycling When You Remodel options and <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-green-home-construction/">our program</a> is discussed up front with our clients.

<strong>Recycling When You Remodel, Here’s How: </strong>
Dirt, clean concrete, wood and mixed debris are separated during construction.

Recycling bins (dirt &amp; concrete) are used when space permits.

Our hauling company recycles dirt, concrete, wood, metals and appliances whenever possible.

This service is provided to our clients at no additional cost.

<strong>Future Recycling Plans</strong>

Eventually we would like to offer more in depth <a href="http://recyclesandiego.org/">deconstruction</a> and recycling when you remodel. We have tried recycling companies that deconstruct just for the materials removed, but they did not prove to be dependable. Hopefully we will find a efficient, dependable firm to handle deconstruction and remodeling at an affordable price in the near future.
