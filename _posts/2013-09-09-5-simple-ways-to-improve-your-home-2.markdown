Sometimes it makes more sense to spend a  little less on a simple improvement project to add value and aesthetic beauty  to your home than to do nothing at all if you just can’t afford that <a href="/san-diego-home-remodeling-services/">home renovation</a> of your dreams right now.

Here  are five simple ways to improve your home and add value while you are at it:

<strong>Get out your paintbrush.</strong> One of the quickest cost-effective  ways to brighten up your home is with a fresh coat of paint. Touch up colors  you already have, take the plunge for a whole new color scheme, <a href="http://thedecorologist.com/please-do-it-right-or-dont-do-it-at-all-the-accent-wall">bold accent wall</a>, or beautifully designed <a href="http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/decorating/wallpaper-designs-00100000084746/index.html#2">wall paper</a>. You can do a professional-looking paint job yourself with  some painting tools from your home improvement store. If you only have a little  bit of money to spend on home remodeling, painting is a good place to start.

<em><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/materials/low-voc-paint.htm">low-VOC paints</a>, which contain fewer volatile  organic compounds than regular paint—chemicals that aren’t exactly safe for you  and your family.</em>

<strong>Create open space.</strong> Homes that make the best use of  the space allotted are often the most comfortable to live in and visit. Consider <a href="http://wcfcourier.com/lifestyles/home-and-garden/decorating/house_plans/plan-well-before-deciding-to-knock-down-walls/article_a5c020d2-32f6-11e0-afa9-001cc4c002e0.html">knocking down a wall</a> or two or turning a wall into a  half wall to open up the floor plan of your home. You can also widen doorways  by a few inches (even up to 12 inches) to give the illusion that there is more  space in your home than there actually is.

<em><strong>Tip:</strong> Be sure to consult with a contractor to be sure there’s nothing hidden inside  the wall you want to demolish.</em>

<strong>Finish your basement.</strong> Consider all the space in your  basement that is sitting idle. What could you do with all that square footage?  Rather than create an addition to your home, reconfigure your basement into a  living space. Add a bar, entertainment area and maybe even a bedroom or two.  Avoid adding too many walls, especially since most basements have a boxy feel  already. The more open your finished basement space, the better.

<em><strong>Tip:</strong> Be sure to <a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/remodeling/10-things-you-must-know-finishing-a-basement/pictures/index.html">follow safety precautions</a> and check the code before  starting your project.</em>

<strong>Spruce up the outside.</strong> In order for any visitors or  potential buyers down the road to see all of your indoor improvements, they  will first see the outside. Ensure your home has curb appeal by taking care of  the exterior. Touch up your paint, add new hardware like your address number,  update your mail box, trim those hedges, plant some flowers, etc. A great way  to gain perspective on your home exterior is to start at the street and walk to  your front door. What do you see that could use an update? Be sure to pay  attention to any back or side yards too.

<em><strong>Tip:</strong> Make your garden work for you. If you haven’t delved into <a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/outdoors/tips-for-a-raised-bed-vegetable-garden/index.html">growing your own food</a>, now is a great time to start!</em>

<strong>Add outdoor living space.</strong> Adding a deck to your home is  one of the smartest ways to add value to it. A report by Remodeling Magazine  found that <a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/2013/costvsvalue/national.aspx">77 percent of wooden deck costs can be  recouped</a> when a  home is sold. But if you don’t plan to sell your home, a deck is a wonderful  place to enjoy your early morning coffee, family dinner, a barbeque, and a lazy  Sunday afternoon reading your favorite book.

<em><strong>Tip:</strong> Check out a <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to-plans/woodworking/4275113">variety of materials for your deck</a>. Each type has its benefits and  drawbacks based on your climate and needs.</em>

When it comes to home remodeling, spending more does not  always mean adding more value. Look for small ways to improve your home over  time and the end result will be space that better reflects your lifestyle—and  will pay you back long term.
