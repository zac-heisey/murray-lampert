Do you have an outdated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">kitchen</span>, or does the layout not fit your needs?  Custom <span style="text-decoration: underline;">kitchen remodeling</span> will give you a functional new look by replacing cabinets, counters, appliances, fixtures and finishes.

Hire a qualified <span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Contractor</span> who will consult with you and create a design/space plan that meets your needs.  Eliminate the guess work by insisting on a design, specifications and complete quote including finishes, fixtures etc.  You should not be obligated to pay upfront design or retainer fees for this service.

Most <span style="text-decoration: underline;">kitchen remodeling</span> requires multiple trades such as framing, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, drywall and stucco.  Often there are modifications to structural walls or window and door changes.  A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Contractor</span> is licensed to handle all the trades required for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">home remodeling</span>.  Cabinet companies can either be unqualified, undertaking work without permits and inspections, or do not have the resources of trades a  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Contractor</span> employs.

With a licensed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Contractor</span> , all the workmanship is warranted by one firm and all work is permitted and inspected.  Not only is important for your own safety, it protects your investment should you ever sell your home.
