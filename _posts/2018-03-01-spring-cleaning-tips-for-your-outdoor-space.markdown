Spring is in the air in San Diego, and warmer weather means more opportunities to spend time outdoors. Oftentimes, we neglect our front and backyards during the colder winter months, and come Spring, there are a few things we can do to bring life back to our outdoor spaces.

Here are a few Spring cleaning tips to get your San Diego outdoor living spaces looking fresh!

## 1. Combat Cobwebs

It’s highly unlikely that you dusted off outdoor cob webs after the busy holiday season. Springtime is the perfect opportunity to combat those cobwebs that accumulate in your eaves, cracks and crevices. This is a super simple task that only requires a duster with a long pole. We like this [outdoor cobweb duster](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Ettore-Webster-Cobweb-Poly-Fiber-Duster-with-Pole-31000/204267864?MERCH=REC-_-rv_search_plp_rr-_-NA-_-204267864-_-N) from Home Depot!

## 2. Wash Exterior Windows

This is something that is so often overlooked, but can make a huge difference! The exteriors of your windows take quite a beating, even in sunny San Diego where the elements are mild. However, you’d be surprised at how much dirt, grime, and water can build up on your windows.

Springtime is the perfect opportunity to make your windows sparkle and shine. There are a lot of window washing techniques out there, but we believe you can keep it simple. Using a non-toxic glass cleaner and an old newspaper will work wonders! If you’ve never cleaned glass with newspaper, you’re just going to have to trust us. Newspaper helps glass cleaner wipe crystal clear and void of streaks!

If you don’t have extra copies of the Sunday paper lying around, [terry cloth towels](https://www.lowes.com/pd/ProLine-24-Pack-Cotton-Towels/50110540) or a [squeegee](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Magic-Rubber-Shower-Squeegee/1000192419?cm_mmc=SCE_PLA-_-FashionFixtures-_-BathStorage-_-1000192419:Magic&CAWELAID=&kpid=1000192419&CAGPSPN=pla&store_code=1013&k_clickID=7c3d2011-88e6-4e07-907f-138462660748&gclid=CjwKCAiAoNTUBRBUEiwAWje2liyMbB680PwobTVDJCQ3F8wjwEZOmZf5Mc05cFaB31Ccx3vQGbDXhBoCl1gQAvD_BwE) will do the trick!

Keep in mind, if you have screens on your windows, you will want to remove them and hose them off before washing the glass windows.

## 3. Mind the Gutters

In San Diego, our gutters hardly suffer the same conditions as other states with real “seasons.” None-the-less, it’s important to avoid damage to your home by forgetting to clean out those gutters. Leaves, sticks, and other debris can build up and cause you major issues if left untreated.

Grab a ladder and a partner to help you with this task. Avoid ladder accidents by enlisting the help of a friend or family member to stabilize the bottom while you quickly sweep  out any debris that has collected over Fall and Winter months.

## 4. Clean Out Your Garage

This spring cleaning to-do is particularly time consuming. You may wish to set aside a whole day or weekend, depending on how cluttered your garage is. Many people can stay fairly organized and use their garage to park their cars. But that’s not the case for everyone. Your garage can often become a disorganized pit. Investing the time to go through everything in your garage has major payoff.

The first step to organizing your garage is to handle it in chunks. Divide the room into quadrants and tackle it section by section. Create separate piles for items that you’ll sell, donate, or throw in the trash. Be realistic and honest with yourself about the items you really need and the ones that you will be okay to part with!

Invest in [garage storage solutions](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Garage-Storage/N-5yc1vZarmi) to help you organize the items that you’ll be keeping. There are plenty of high quality and durable options at your local hardware store. Once this job is completed, you’ll breathe a sigh of relief over how clean and orderly your new garage looks!

## 5. Audit Your Lighting

Do a scan of your [outdoor living space](/san-diego-outdoor-living-space-design) to seek out any flickering bulbs or lights that need to be replaced. Walk along walkways and check the lighting along major doorways. We’re all guilty of forgetting to replace an outdoor lightbulb. Spring is the perfect time to nip it in the bud and get brand new, [energy efficient lightbulbs](https://energy.gov/energysaver/save-electricity-and-fuel/lighting-choices-save-you-money) in your outdoor space!

## 6. Wash Your Outdoor Furniture

If you have outdoor seating with cushions, pillows and similar accessories, it’s time to give them a scrub. Many outdoor seating collections allow you to remove covers so you can throw them in the washer and dryer. After you remove cushions and pillowcases, you can hose down the furniture itself. It’s highly likely that dirt and dust have accumulated in your patio furniture over winter. Dust off your outdoor seating and you’ll be all set for spring and summer outdoor entertaining!

## 7. Give Fencing Some TLC

If you have wooden fencing at home, it’s a good idea to walk the perimeter of your home and identify any loose areas or wood rot. If it’s been a few years since you’ve treated your wooden fence, we recommend taking the time to do that in Spring!

If your fence is made from metal or another material, walk along the fence and keep your eye out for any holes or spots that are pulling away from the ground.

## 8. Touchup Your Home With Paint

Springtime is the perfect time to touch up any chipped away areas on the outside of your home. Walk around your house and make a list of anything that could use a fresh coat of paint. This could be the fencing, shutters, mailboxes, or even front and back doors.
