On December 7, 2010, <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com">Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel</a> received their third <a href="http://www.sd.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau</a> Torch Award in 4 years.  The Torch Award is presented to businesses who demonstrate exemplary ethics in the  <a href="http://www.sdnn.com">San Diego Marketplace</a>.

Completing an entry for the <a href="http://sandiego.bbb.org/2010-torch-awards-entry-form/">Better Business Bureau Torch Awards</a> is a company wide project that takes months of preparation.  Each time we go through the process, it reinforces to me how dedicated and loyal our team members are.  It is obvious how much pride our company has because I can see it in the eyes of my staff.

The most import part of submitting an entry for the San Diego Better Business Bureau Torch Awards is not winning a trophy.  It is being recognized for ethics and trust in the <a href="http://www.sandiego.com">San Diego</a> marketplace because of the way the entire <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/about/">Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel Team</a> treats our clients and gives back to the community.
