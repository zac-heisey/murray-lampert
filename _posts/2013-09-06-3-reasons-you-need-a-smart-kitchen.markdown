Or if your oven could call  the repairman for you when something was broken—and could tell him exactly what  he needed to fix before he even arrived? It may sound like the stuff of science  fiction, but smart kitchens with intuitive appliances are the wave of the near  future. But do you really need a smart kitchen? Let’s take a look at some of  the reasons why you might.
<h2>Convenience</h2>
People used to scoff at the idea of a cell phone that also  worked as a personal assistant and handheld computer, but now <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/06/06/more-than-half-of-us-have-smartphones-giving-apple-and-google-much-to-smile-about/">over  half of all U.S. adults own smartphones</a>. You won’t find many people getting  rid of smartphones because owners have come to depend on the convenience these  tools provide and the efficiency they bring. The same is true of items in a  smart kitchen. A refrigerator that helps you create meals and create grocery  lists is one that saves you time and money. Appliances that are intuitive take  the guesswork out of your daily kitchen routine, helping you to be more  productive and less forgetful. With all of the different technology on the  market designed for pure entertainment, it makes sense that smart kitchens with  practical applications are currently being designed.
<h2>Lower maintenance  costs</h2>
Smart models of new appliances by LG have a feature called <a href="http://www.lgblog.co.uk/2012/06/smart-diagnosis/">Smart Diagnosis</a> that  is designed to streamline the maintenance and repair process. These smart  machines do not simply call a repairman—they give owners instructions on how to  make repairs first, particularly if it is something easy like a clog or filter  replacement. Consumers are given more options when it comes to the upkeep of  their kitchen appliances with smart technology. They can opt to fix problems on  their own or to reach out to professionals. Some will still feel most  comfortable calling for help when kitchen appliances need some extra attention  but the option for do-it-yourself repairs will be there. Either way, consumers  know what is wrong upfront and this leads to more informed maintenance and  repair decisions.
<h2>Ease of use</h2>
Despite the complexities of smartphones, just about anyone  can figure out how to work one in a matter of minutes. The same is true of  smart kitchen appliances. The newest models are equipped with touchscreens and  some even connect to smartphones so kitchen tasks can be done remotely (how  nice would it be to start preheating your oven on the way home from work with  the touch of a button on your smartphone?). As more smart appliances hit the  market, expect the technology to get even simpler to use—more so than the  average refrigerators, microwaves, and ovens in traditional kitchens.

The technology for your own smart kitchen exists. In just a  few years, smart kitchens may be as commonplace as smartphones. As you make  <a href="/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services/">upgrades to your kitchen</a>, consider swapping out traditional appliances for  intuitive ones that make your life easier.
