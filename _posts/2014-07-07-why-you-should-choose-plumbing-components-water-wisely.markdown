Water-wise plumbing components aren’t just great for the environment—they can be great for your budget, too! The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certifies many types of plumbing components to help each one of us do our part to conserve water and save money on our monthly water and energy bills. Here we’ll take a look at a few different pieces of household plumbing and how choosing a water-efficient model of each can help save the planet and your pocketbook.

<strong>Toilets</strong>

Toilets use more water than any other appliance within the home. Older toilets can use up to 3.5 gallons of water per flush. Replacing these toilets (any toilet manufactured before 1992) can save a family of four $2,000 in water bills during the lifetime of the toilet.

Dual flush toilets are also making a splash on the market, allowing the user some say in their water flow and offering greater efficiency. Look for these options and seek out the WaterSense label to get the most out of your next plumbing purchase.

<strong>Faucets</strong>

Faucets also garner a high percentage of household water, accounting for more than 15% of a family’s water use. Using a WaterSense labeled faucet can reduce water flow by 30 percent and limit water flow to 1.5 gallons per minute, saving you money every time you turn on the faucet. In addition, replacing faucet aerators can save a family 700 gallons of water per year (or 40 showers worth of water!)

<strong>Showerheads</strong>

Showerheads alone can account for up to 17% of water use. Changing out shower fixtures in your home can save 20-60 percent of water use without sacrificing water flow. This can cut your water use and slash that water bill each month.

The average family can save almost 3,000 gallons of water per year simply by replacing old showerheads with WaterSense models. And lo and behold, they also save energy, up to 370 kilowatt hours annually (enough to power your home for almost two weeks)!

<strong>Appliances<a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/fridge.png"><img class="wp-image-2227 alignright" alt="Refridgerator" src="http://www.murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/fridge.png" width="125" height="144" /></a></strong>

Appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines can also use a large amount of water.

In fact, the average washing machine can use up to 41 gallons of water per load! Water-wise washing machines use 35-50% less water and energy per load. Look for the ENERGY STAR® label when you are shopping for new appliances and you can <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/cutting-down-on-your-energy-bills/">save on your energy bill</a> each month.
