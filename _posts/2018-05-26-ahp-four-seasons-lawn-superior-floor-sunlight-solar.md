The Memorial Day Weekend episode of the [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/the-approved-home-pro-radio-show-four-seasons-lawn-aeration-superior-floor-and-cabinet-designs-sunlight-solar/) features Dominic Carlos from [Four Seasons Lawn Aertion](http://www.lawnaerating.com/) talking about the benefits of aerating your lawn, and Cheryl Robertson at [Superior Floor and Cabinet Designs](http://www.superiorfloors.com/) explaining how to choose the right type of flooring for your lifestyle and budget. We also have Charlton Johnson from [Sunlight Solar](https://www.sunlightsolarinc.com/) pointing out some key signs to watch for that might indicate it's time to re-evaluate your solar situation.

This week's Cantor's Corner segment focuses on the importance of having an interior designer on board as part of the home improvement process. When you work with a builder _and_ an interior designer who are on the same page, things are more transparent, less confusing, and usually equate to fewer surprises and lower costs for homeowners.
