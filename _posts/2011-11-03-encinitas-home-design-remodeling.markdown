Located just 25 miles north of San Diego proper, Encinitas is a beautiful, coastal beach city. The city’s largest industry is the growing and cultivating of ornamental flowers, particularly poinsettias. Well-known for its mild climate and surf scene, Encinitas perfectly illustrates the laidback, beach-going vibe of Southern California, great for tourists and locals alike.
