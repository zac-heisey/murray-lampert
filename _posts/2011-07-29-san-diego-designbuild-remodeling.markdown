Many San Diego Design/Build Remodeling  companies say they are design/build and outsource the drafting, losing control of design quality and costs.  You must insist on in an house design/ build team who delivers full service to you.

Make sure a comprehensive “Scope of Work” document is part of the design package too.  That way you can be certain everything is included.  You will want to go shopping to make sure the caliber of fixtures, appliances and finishes are covered.

Do not be enticed by companies who substantially undercut other bidders.  Later on, you will find out there are hidden costs, and items like cabinets, granite, finish work etc. are low quality and you are in store for major cost overruns.

A qualified San Diego Design/Build Remodeling firm will assist you in creating a shopping list and line you up with preferred vendors to save you money.  They will also help by value engineering to help you meet your desired remodeling investment.

It today’s economy, Design/Build is the most effective method to improve your home delivering more value to you..  With Design/Build you and the contractor have control of the design and construction details. What that means is you won’t end up with a plan that is cost prohibitive and you will get more for you money.
