Whether you’re remodeling your kitchen, and single bathroom, or your entire home, choosing the perfect plumbing fixtures to match your decor and style can be a rewarding experience. Not only do new fixtures stand to increase your home’s value, but you can choose new and innovative plumbing technologies to bring your home definitively into the 21st century.

Below, we’ll discuss the top plumbing fixtures that add value to your home and some of the newest and most exciting fixture options to modernize your house. We’ll also discuss some considerations you should make during your remodel and some issues to avoid.

## Top Plumbing Fixtures That Increase Home Value

Looking to add a touch of elegance to your home remodel and boost your property’s value in the meantime? The below plumbing fixtures are among the best ones to add to accomplish both.

**Farmhouse Sink**
One of the most popular and trendy plumbing fixtures available today for kitchen remodels is a farmhouse sink, also known as a drop-in sink. These sink bodies are visible from the front and typically sit beneath the countertop for an exposed look.

Drop-in sinks are also popular now because they can double as added counter space if you plan ahead. During your remodel, ask your contractor to leave an exposed top edge all the way around the sink. You can later fit a matching piece of countertop over it or a custom cutting board to add beauty and functionality to your kitchen.

**Bidet Add-On**  
Many Americans are now considering installing bidets in their homes. While stand-alone bidets are popular in Europe, Americans now have the option for an add-on bidet, which attaches to your toilet and reduces the need for toilet paper.

Bidets use more water than toilets alone and might be problematic in states that experience drought. However, you can still call in a [local plumber in California](https://www.mrblueplumbing.com/plumber/ca/) or another area where water restrictions exist to install a low-flow, high-efficiency bidet add-on. This device will instantly add value to your home and make it more appealing to buyers looking for a modernized home.

**Tankless Water Heater**  
Finally, a tankless water heater is a very appealing plumbing option for buyers, so they can drastically improve the value of your property. Unlike tank heaters, tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, deliver [unlimited hot water](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters) to all of your fixtures.

Tankless water heaters make things like cold showers and managing which appliances are running when you do the dishes a thing of the past.

## New Plumbing Technologies to Install During Your Remodel

If you want to add value to your home and bring a modern or even futuristic touch at the same time, the below new plumbing technologies can help you do just that!

**Hot Water Recirculation**
Hot water recirculation is often likened to a tankless water heater, but it provides a distinct benefit that tankless heaters cannot offer. Hot water recirculation systems constantly circulate hot water through your supply pipes so that the water is instantly hot when you need it.

Even with tankless water heaters that supply unlimited hot water, the water that is heated and then sits in the pipes will cool, causing you to have to wait for the shower or sink to heat up before use. A hot water recirculation system uses more energy but offers the convenience of instantly hot water at all times.

**Smart Irrigation**
If you’re remodeling your home and you have a sprinkler system installed, you may want to consider installing a smart irrigation system as well. These systems provide a wall-mounted access point to control your sprinklers, set them on custom timers, and control zones at the touch of a button. Most systems also connect to WiFi, so you can control your irrigation system from your phone no matter where you are to [save money and reduce wasted water](https://www.epa.gov/watersense/watersense-labeled-controllers).

**Leak Detection Systems**
One of the most practical ways to make your house more technologically advanced is to install a leak detection system. The most advanced systems attach to your water meter or just inside your water main, and they can detect when a leak is occurring in your home.

Whether a pipe freezes and bursts, a pinhole leak forms from old age, or some physical damage causes water to start pouring into your home, the system will automatically shut the water main off to stop the leak and minimize the damage. Most systems also connect to WiFi and can alert you remotely if there is an issue. No more worrying about leaks in your home while you’re at work or on vacation!

## Plumbing Considerations to Make During a Remodel

When your home remodel is complete, the last thing you want is to realize you wish you had done something differently. Below are some of the most common plumbing mistakes made during a home remodel that you can avoid by careful planning.

**Not Installing a Water Filtration System**
When you have a plumber on-site to complete your plumbing upgrades, it’s a good idea to install a water filtration system at the same time. This will save you money on labor and prevent you from having to pay for one after the fact or spend money on bottled water or stand-alone filter pitchers. Countless homeowners complete remodels without installing one and later regret not upgrading when the connection points were exposed anyway.

**Not Upgrading Pipes**
When you have your plumbing system exposed during your remodel, it’s a good idea to consider upgrading or replacing the pipes. Your plumber can help you decide if PEX is a viable option, but even replacing aging copper pipes will help avoid leaks and low water pressure. It might seem like an unnecessary upgrade, but doing the work when your walls are already open can save you hundreds of dollars in the long run.

### Wrapping Up: Adding Value to Your Home With Plumbing
Plumbing fixtures can be some of the most expensive pieces of equipment during a home remodel. However, knowing which ones add the most value to your home can help you get the most out of your remodel. Bringing the most technologically advanced capabilities to your home with innovative plumbing fixtures can add value as well while also adding functionality and practicality to your home.
