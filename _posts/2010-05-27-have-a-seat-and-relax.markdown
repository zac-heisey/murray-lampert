A simple and great feature is a bay window seat. <a href="http://murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Bay-Window2.jpg"></a> Mr. &amp; Mrs. K in University City really enjoy their new room addition which includes a walk in closet, bathroom and this comfy bay with Milgard windows.  Get more window ideas by visiting <a href="http://www.milgard.com/planning-your-project/where-to-start/">http://www.milgard.com/planning-your-project/where-to-start/</a>.
