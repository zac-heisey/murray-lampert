On this week's edition of the [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/approved-home-pro-radio-show-system-pavers-care-plumbing-heating-air/), we have Chris Lavoie from [Reborn Cabinets](https://www.reborncabinets.com/) talking about new trends in kitchens and baths. Bert Huff at [Hague Quality Water](http://sandiego.haguewater.com/) also addresses common hard water questions, and explains the benefits of water softeners.

We also end this week's show with a short Cantor's Corner segment about the importance of roofing in solar. Too many solar contractors lack the proper roofing knowledge to ensure that your roof won't be damaged when your new solar panels are installed. This is why we always recommend working with a contractor like [Milholland Solar Electric & Roofing](/home-improvement-pros-we-love-to-work-with-milholland-solar-electric-roofing/) who specializes in both solar installation and roofing.
