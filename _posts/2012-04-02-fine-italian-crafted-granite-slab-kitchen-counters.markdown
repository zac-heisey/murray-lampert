Homeowners find it fun and exciting to go to the yard, and choose their slabs.  Each slab is tagged and numbered.  After the granite fabricator templates the kitchen, the slabs are transported for cutting.

Modern granite fabricators have expensive equipment.  It is a very precise job to cut and fabricate granite.  Most shops use computers, lasers and diamond cutting tools.  Since edges are made up of two or three pieces of granite, perfect cuts are necessary to ensure invisible joints.

You can expect a lifetime of enjoyment out of your granite counters with very little maintenance required.  An easy application of sealer every few years will keep your counter tops looking like the day they were installed.
