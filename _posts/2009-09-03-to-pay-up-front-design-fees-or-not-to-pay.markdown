<div>Many Design/Build Contractors charge up front, non-refundable design fee retainers. This is a way for the contractor to get you the Home Owner off the market. Frequently, as the design is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">developed</span>, the price goes up <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">exponentially</span>. The design fee retainer, which is typically in the range of $3,000 to $5,000, deters you from looking elsewhere, because you made an investment with one builder.
