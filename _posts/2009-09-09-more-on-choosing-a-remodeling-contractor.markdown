Here are more things to consider when choosing a contractor to remodel your home:

1. What is the companies track record for finishing on time?
2. Do they have a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">reputation</span> for coming in on budget, or are change orders to be expected?
3. Are the allowances for fixtures, appliances, finishes realistic, or will there be cost over runs?
4. What is the warranty the company provides?

Interview past clients to find out the answers to these questions.
