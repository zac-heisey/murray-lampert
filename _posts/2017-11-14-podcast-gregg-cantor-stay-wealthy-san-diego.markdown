I recently had the privilege of being a guest on Taylor Schulte's podcast, [Stay Wealthy San Diego](https://www.staywealthysandiego.com). If you haven't checked out Taylor's podcast before, I highly suggest you do so. It offers really great insights and actionable ideas on how to manage and maximize wealth. Taylor has also had on some amazing guests, so I was honored to be able to represent Murray Lampert on his show.

Among the things Taylor and I discussed were the beginnings of Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel, how we've grown into one of the most trusted [home remodeling companies in San Diego](/san-diego-home-remodel-services), and how we've used clear, open communication to build relationships and stay ahead of the competition for over 40 years.
