On a similar vein, the 5th most popular image on Houzz is one that showcases one of the many kitchen storage possibilities at a homeowner’s disposal. Chances are, you find yourself frustrated at least once a week while searching for a kitchen utensil. Standard drawers become dark pits that make it difficult to find what you need. We absolutely love how this faux drawer appears as though it is two separate pieces, but once you pull it open, it reveals organizers that display your kitchen utensils vertically. Who wouldn’t love something like this in their kitchen?
