If you’ve ever watched a home remodeling program, you’re well aware that potential problems can spring up. That’s why it’s important to be aware of the most common mistakes homeowners make during the remodeling process to prevent and avoid such disasters. Remodeling can be a large financial undertaking, and mistakes can double—or even triple—the original cost.

Here we’ll explore some of the most common mistakes and how you can dodge remodeling danger.

<b>Evaluating Your Contractor </b>

The most difficult part of remodeling is knowing who to trust. Because very few homeowners have hands-on experience with remodeling, it’s hard to know if your contractor is inflating costs or being realistic about timelines. This is one industry wherein you need proof of the contractor’s track record.

<b>Failing to Plan</b>

A proper plan is vital to the success of a project. Like the old adage “measure twice, cut once”, planning out your project in advance can save time, money, and heartache. It can also help you highlight problems conceptually before you have to handle them in reality.

Map out the costs and materials, and spec out the sizes and amount of materials beforehand. Making sure you can procure proper materials in adequate amounts can keep you from ending up with only half of a completed project. This can also help you keep costs down. By truly doing your research in advance, you can make decisions about costly items before they eat up your remodeling budget.

</ul>
<b>Changing Your Mind Midstream </b>

This is where that proper planning comes in. Make your decisions before you begin, and make sure that you’re content with the plan. Changing your mind on materials and layout takes additional time and money, and can also cause unnecessary tension between you and your contractor. Many materials must be purchased ahead of time, and often cannot be returned or sold off without highly discounting the product—especially if they have been tailored to your specific space.

</ul>
<b>Going Too Cheap </b>

Just because you should be mindful of the costs does not mean you should be too frugal. Cheap materials can be costly over the long haul if they’ll break down in 2-3 years. Oftentimes, an item that is half the price will also only have half the longevity. Confer with your contractor and choose something that is solidly made.

<b>Going Too Far Out of Style</b>

You have always wanted to live in a colonial castle? That doesn’t mean you should try and crop one up in the middle of a modern, streamlined neighborhood. Take a look at your neighbors and be mindful of the area you live in. Going too far outside of the norm can actually hurt your home’s resale value.

Take some time to ensure that your remodeling plan doesn’t follow these five common pitfalls, and you’ll be five times more likely to have your project go off without a hitch!
