## Easy to Maintain and Energy-Efficient

[Building a log cabin](https://riverwoodcabins.com/cabins/) ADU offers many benefits. For one, they are simple to maintain by washing them once and chinking (sealing) the structure annually. Regular visual inspections also allow you to determine cracks, molds or infestations, while staining the logs every 3 years preserves the life of the cabin. Another advantage is log cabins are energy-efficient. In most US climates, the use of thermal mass in log cabins can [control and reduce annual heating costs](https://loghomes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/EnergyPerformanceWP_2010.pdf). According to an NAHB Study, log homes are 2.5% to 15% more energy-efficient than standard stick-frame constructions.

## Lower Noise Levels and Aesthetic Appeal

Moreover, log cabins can reduce noise levels by reducing the transmission and travel of airborne sound. Log walls deflect sound depending on the shape, surface and angle of the wood. Log cabins are rustic, have an aesthetic appeal and give a feeling of being close to nature. They are flexible enough to allow modern design constructions for comfort and even luxury.
