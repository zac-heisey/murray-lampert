The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) trend is sweeping through California, but few homeowners understand their options when it comes to building them. Aside from zoning and legal requirements that need to be met, there’s also the type of ADU to take into account when planning an [in-law suite in San Diego](/san-diego-in-law-suites).

To help get you started, we’ve put together a high-level overview of some common ADU types, as well as some of the pros and cons of each type.
