This week on the [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/approved-home-pros-radio-show-reborn-cabinets-best-value-glass-superior-window-solutions/) we are joined by [Reborn Cabinets](https://www.reborncabinets.com/), who talks about how they've maintained such a high level of value, dedication, and expertise for 35 years. We also talk with [Superior Window Solutions](https://www.superiorwindowsolutions.com/) about the benefits of adding window shades in your home, and [Best Value Glass](https://www.bvglass.com/) stops by to explain the various options available when it comes to shower doors.

On Cantor's Corner, we talk about the importance of working with a contractor or [remodeling company](/san-diego-home-remodel-services) who is able to accommodate pets during the remodeling process. The comfort and safety of your pets should not be overlooked as you begin to plan your next home improvement project, including designating a "safe room" or putting up temporary fencing so pets remain safe and secure during your remodeling project.
