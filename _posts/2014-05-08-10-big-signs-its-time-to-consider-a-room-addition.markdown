Room additions vary in size, shape, and location. There are 2-wall, 3-wall, single-story, second-story, and two-story <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-room-additions/">room additions</a>. Room additions can include family rooms, great rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, laundry rooms, guest rooms, home offices and garages, just to name a few.
