In any [home remodeling project](/san-diego-remodel-project-gallery), the safety of both homeowners and contractors is of the utmost importance. The same should also be said for our furry friends as well. Making sure our pets have a safe and secure place to stay during construction, as well as protection from noise is very important.

As part of our initial consultation, we always get to know homeowners and their pets so proper accommodations can be made. This might include "safe rooms" for pets, or figuring out an offsite place for them to stay during the remodeling project.

[Contact our team](#quick-contact) to learn more about our full consultation process.
