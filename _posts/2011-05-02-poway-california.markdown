The area is family-friendly and the majority of the residents are families of three or more. Although it has grown dramatically in the past couple decades, it still maintains a strong grip on its country culture. Owning a horse or two is commonplace in Poway and the city hosts San Diego’s largest annual rodeo. It is located directly in the center of the greater San Diego County, giving residents easy access to everything San Diego has to offer. The beaches, downtown, mountains, desert, and amusement parks are all within a 30 minute drive. It is a great place for raising children as it boasts far above average schools and plenty of great outdoor activities nearby.<img class="alignright" style="margin: 5px;" src="http://www.murraylampert.com/images/gallery/ra/webb.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="362" />

Historically, Poway was used for farm land and cattle stocking, but the modern road development gave the area direct access to other parts of San Diego. The city was incorporated in 1980 and has boomed since then with an estimated population of just over 50,000. Since Poway is just east of Interstate 15, most residents are raising children there and commuting to work in the nearby San Diego areas. The town is primarily a residential neighborhood with a total of 30 elementary, middle, and high schools. All of the school’s high success rates for standardized tests and are above the national averages. The median income for a household in Poway is $71,708. The area boasts some of California’s best and most consistent weather as the winter average high never drops below 67 degrees Fahrenheit and the summer average never exceeds 82 degrees. San Diego is very desert like and there is usually little rain in Poway, less than 12 inches per year. This is a red flag for fire season and forces the community to constantly take precautionary measures for preventing and defending against wildfires.

Since the lot sizes in Poway are typically large, family room and <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-room-additions/">bedroom additions</a> are always popular. Being that the Poway is inland it gets hot in the summer time.  When remodeling, a reputable <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-design-build-contractors/">design/build contractor</a> can help you cut down on cooling costs by using energy efficient dual glazed windows, orientating the building so as to avoid direct sun through glazing and use other building practices. There are a large amount of homes that are 25 plus years old in Poway, so <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services/">kitchen remodeling</a> and <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-bathroom-remodeling-services/">bathroom remodeling</a> are also very popular.
