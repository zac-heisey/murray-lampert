As the weather improves for us in San Diego, now is the time to start thinking about how you'll spend those long days and warm nights entertaining outdoors. Our guests on [this week's Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/approved-home-pro-radio-show-expressions-home-gallery-seasons-windows-patios/) include [Expressions Home Gallery](https://www.expressionshomegallery.com/), who talks new technology and popular outdoor appliance trends. We also have [All Seasons Windows & Patios](https://allseasonswindowsandpatios.com/) outline the benefits of incorporating multiple outdoor upgrades with a single contractor, which is very much in line with our [design-build approach to home remodeling](/san-diego-design-build-contractors) projects.
