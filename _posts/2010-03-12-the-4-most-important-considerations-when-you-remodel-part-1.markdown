<strong>Quality<a href="http://murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/images2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-91" title="images" src="http://murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/images2.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="176" /></a></strong>

The sweet taste of low price is quickly forgotten when quality is lacking. 

Every contractor uses different trades, materials, vendors and project management.  Also, the quality some contractors deliver is dependent on how much profit there is in the job.  A reputable contractor uses the same quality materials, trades and building practices on all projects regardless of how much profit there is.

A common tactic is a remodeler will come in low up front and add change orders during the course of the project to make up for the shortfall.  Another, is some contractors will entice you with a beautiful plan showing finish details that are not included in the contract, or to knowingly under estimate allowances for finish materials and fixtures. 

Do research up front by checking contractors out at <a href="http://www.sd.bbb.org">www.sd.bbb.org</a> and <a href="http://www.cslb.ca.gov">www.cslb.ca.gov</a>.  Pay close attention to quantity and nature of online client reviews.  Also, call some past and current references and ask these questions:

1.  Was your project completed on budget?

2.  Did you get everything you were promised?

3.  Are you satisfied with the quality?

4.  Would you use the company again?

As tempting as it may be when you are quoted a low price, make an educated decision.  Keep in mind, you will not find out if you made a mistake until it is too late.  Unfortunately, that will mean you get less then expected and/or pay much more.
