Developed as a distinct community during the 60s and 70s, Del Cerro is Spanish for “of the hill” and its building structures range in both size and architectural design. <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-home-design-serivces/">Contemporary home design</a> and ranch style homes can be seen throughout the Del Cerro area. With long lines of residential homes, Del Cerro is known for being quiet, walkable, kid-friendly, and ideal for the single family unit. Located in central San Diego just east of Mission Valley, backyard pools are a common inclusion in the landscape architecture of these family homes.

Contemporary design first came to the Del Cerro area in 1958 with the ‘Parade of Homes’ project of Richard Lareau. His Pan-Pacific house was built with advanced electrical options, as this modern gateway era sought out innovative design both aesthetically and functionally. This trend has been maintained in the area, as a good many of the residences are well-established—built between 1940 and 1969. These Del Cerro Highland homes cater to the contemporary style and family life with large floor plans and updated amenities. Although there are some rowhouses, attached homes, and small apartments, the Ranch style home is most prevalent architectural style in the area. This type of home is designed to have historically recognizable features, but also a great deal of individuality. Custom ranch-style developments are a common theme all across the rolling hills of San Diego, and the Del Cerro area ties in well with the rest of the city.
