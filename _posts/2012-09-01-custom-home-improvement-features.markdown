I recently attended a Lutron product knowledge seminar and learned about some innovative products for <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-architectural-design-services/">custom home improvements</a>.

Lutron is known for their electrical switches, dimmers, receptacles and lighting.  What you might not know is they also manufacture electronically operated shades, blinds, curtains and drapes. Their <a href="http://www.lutron.com/Products/StandAloneControls/Dimmers-Switches/Pages/DimmersSwitches.aspx">integrated controller</a> is design to work with Lutron lighting and window covering systems for a custom home improvement.

If simple is all you want, then the palm sized remote is all that is needed.  The Lutron remote controlled switches install just light a standard rocker switch.  For "Smart Home" applications, the Lutron system can be run with computer software.  Your lighting, <a href="http://www.lutron.com/Residential-Commercial-Solutions/Residential-Solutions/Pages/ShadingSolutions.aspx">window coverings and skylight shades</a> can be  programmed by time or even based on the axis of the sun.

Subtle <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/san-diego-design-build-contractors/">Custom Home Improvement</a> Features can just be included for your convenience or if you are looking to be more energy efficient, automation is the answer.
