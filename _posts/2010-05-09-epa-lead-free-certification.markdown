In California, as of April 2010, all contractors are required to be certified through the EPA Lead Safe program.  This for the safety of you the consumer.  Your contractor is liable for proper testing, handling and disposal of construction material through a licensed abatement company.  All homes built prior to 1979 should be tested for hazardous materials.  For more information click here:  <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lead/">http://www.epa.gov/lead/</a>
