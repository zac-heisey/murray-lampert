Alright folks, it's Summertime and we all know that means outdoor entertaining for those living in San Diego. Often times, hosting a party can mean being stuck at the grill or running around like a chicken with its head cut off, neither of which are not particularly enjoyable. Entertaining guests in your [outdoor kitchen](/san-diego-outdoor-kitchen-remodeling) should be stress-free and fun; and, you should be able to enjoy the party alongside your guests without having to play grill-master the entire time.

We love hosting a stress-free party (or two) over Summer, so we find ourselves scouring for creative and time-efficient recipes to impress our guests while keeping the host happy. So, why not share the love? Here are some recipes we think you need to try this Summer!

## Thai Peanut Chicken Skewers:

This recipe is amazing because you can prep everything the night before and throw them on the grill when youâ€™re ready. Chicken grills quickly and finger foods always fair nicely at parties. The peanut sauce is to die for. Full recipe [here](https://www.savorynothings.com/chicken-skewers-with-satay-style-peanut-sauce/).

## Easy Summer Corn Salad:

When you have a party to throw (not to mention attend), there isnâ€™t a lot of time for chopping vegetables. This Summer corn salad is so easy and pairs with just about anything. Forget endless chopping â€“ youâ€™ll have this recipe finished in under 10 minutes. As a bonus â€“ you can also make this the night before your party and no one will know the difference.

We believe that every party needs dessert, but it doesnâ€™t need to be complicated or store bought. This recipe has less than 5 ingredients and takes 5 minutes to make. Your guests will absolutely love this dish â€“ and youâ€™ll win some major brownie points with the health conscious crowd!

What party is complete without a Summer cocktail? We love this raspberry peach lemonade with a twist (of vodka, that is!). However, light rum doesnâ€™t sound bad either ðŸ™‚. We love this recipe because it can be made the night before and kept in the refrigerator overnight until youâ€™re ready to start the party! Serving this in glass or plasticware alongside a cute straw makes it look much fancier than it is. Full recipe [here](http://www.thechunkychef.com/homemade-raspberry-peach-lemonade/).

If these Summer recipes don't have your mouth watering, we don't know what will! If you try any of these for your parties this Summer, let us know what you think!
