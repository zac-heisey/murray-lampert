Have you ever dreamed about having your own ballroom or dance studio in your home? Sadly, most modern homes don't come with these specialized rooms. And you probably can't find any local manors or other houses that would have these rooms, much less afford these properties when you find them.

However, even if your budget can't accommodate an entire Victorian manor house, it probably can handle an addition or renovation. And you can use that addition or renovation to build your dream ballroom on your property.

To build a ballroom or dance studio, you'll need help from a few expert contractors. You'll also need a little ingenuity on your part. To get started, have a look at the steps outlined below.

<strong>1. Decide If You Want an Addition, a Renovation, or a Separate Structure<img class=" wp-image-2883 alignright" src="http://murraylampert.com/wp-content/uploads/cintron-floor-1024x685.jpg" alt="cintron floor" width="505" height="338" /></strong>

Before you do anything else, you have to decide what kind of studio you want to add to your property. You have three options.

First, you could add an addition. An addition attaches directly to your home, which means that one part of your home will be under construction for a little while. Many homeowners choose to tack their additions onto their back door areas, but you can add an addition anywhere. An addition uses the same electricity, water, and HVAC unit as the rest of your home, so you won't have to install much more piping or ventilation.

Second, you could renovate part of your existing home, such as an unfinished basement or a spare sitting room, into a studio. You won't have to add plumbing, ductwork, or electricity at all, but you will have to occupy room in your house that you could have otherwise turned into a home theater or a guest bedroom.

Third, you could build a separate structure in your backyard. You'll have to run more feet of pipes and wires to this structure, and you may even have to give it a separate HVAC system. However, you'll keep the noise and the crowd away from the rest of your home, which may earn appreciation from your spouse, children, and guests.

Decide which of these options suits your needs best. An addition may give you the best compromise, but only you can choose which type of studio caters to your vision.

<strong>2. Set Aside the Right Amount of Space</strong>

The space you need depends on the number of dancers and the style of dance. However, no matter what, you will need several yards of space. At minimum, expect your dance studio to occupy 10 yards by 7.5 yards. This size gives you plenty of room for dances that require traveling, even if you have groups of 18 people or more on the dance floor.

<strong>3. Consult With Your Contractors to Draft a Floor Plan</strong>

Once you know where you want your studio to go and how much space it needs to occupy, you can meet with the experts to create a floor plan. Let them know where you'd like lighting, speakers, outlets, and other features to go. These experts can also tell you how to make the space more energy efficient. After all, you don't want your power bills to spike just because you have to heat, cool, and light this space.

During this planning session, decide where you'd like windows and mirrors to go as well. Every dance studio needs mirrors so dancers can check their posture and form. Every dance studio needs windows as well. Those windows can line one wall, or they can line the ceiling clerestory style. Choose windows as elegant or simple as your tastes dictate.

Let your contractors know about your flooring preferences as well. Most studios use Marley mats or wood. Marley mats are more forgiving on feet, while wood weathers better. You may also want to consider installing soundproofing materials in your studio's walls.

<strong>4. Install Your Studio's or Ballroom's Must-Have Accessories</strong>

Once your contractors have built your ballroom into a working structure, you can add accessories that really turn the room into a studio. These accessories include:
<ul>
	<li>Surround sound and large speakers</li>
	<li>Studio lighting that illuminates every part of the room</li>
	<li>Bars and mats if your activities will include ballet or acrobatics</li>
	<li>Paint colors and décor that suit your personal style (think of paper lanterns, wall murals, and other features that encourage creativity)</li>
	<li>Storage stations for water bottles and costumes</li>
</ul>
Your dance studio should look professional, but it shouldn't seem severe and strict. Dance is about selfexpression, even when you follow precise steps and patterns. Help your dancers loosen up by creating a fun atmosphere through your décor.
