<div>One of the biggest fears homeowners have about remodeling and contractors are change orders. Changes are a normal part of any home improvement project. A reputable contractor will not take advantage of you with <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">unmerited</span> change orders. Also, if you are presented with change orders for work not requested, do not just sign off. Most contracts state that no additional work shall be performed without a valid change order.</div>
<div>Here are some typical situations where change orders apply:</div>
<div>1. Documentation of a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">pre</span>-existing field conditions.</div>
<div>2. Deviations from the plans or specifications due to code requirements or measurement discrepancies.</div>
<div>3. Material, fixture, or finish upgrades requested by owner.</div>
<div>4. Plan changes.</div>
<div>5. Additional work requested by owner.</div>
<div>A word of caution. Be wary of a home <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">remodeler</span> that comes in with a low price. Some contractors intentionally undercut bidders knowing that they will use change orders as a means generating more profit during the course of work. Ask for references, so you can ask them if the original contract price was honored.</div>
