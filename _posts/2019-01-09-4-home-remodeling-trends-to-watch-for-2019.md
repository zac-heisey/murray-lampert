### 1. Wood Soffits and Exterior Walls

Sometimes called wooden boxed eaves, wood soffits are used to close off the underside of the rafter. It typically runs from the exterior wall of the home to a fascia board. While it does look stylish, the soffits also serve a functional purpose. They protect rafters and the overhangs of roofs from the damage often caused by nature.

Many contemporary-styled homes are also taking the wooden look a step further by creating wooden exterior made from hardwood siding. Homeowners are drawn to this style for multiple reasons. These include the look or style, ease of installation, easy replacement and the fact that wood is biodegradable. The most popular choices for hardwood sidings are cedar and redwood due to their natural resistance to decay.

### 2. Commercial-Style Narrow Frame Windows

Perhaps for security and energy reasons, older homes tend to feature smaller windows and fewer placements. Now that the home security and energy fields have advanced by leaps and bounds, more modern homes are making use of entire walls of glass running from floor to ceiling. Previously, this style coupled with narrow frames was a staple of commercial buildings and high-end high-rise hotels, as the windows offered panoramic views and let in beautiful natural light. But apparently, more people now want to enjoy these same benefits at home.

When upgrading to larger windows, it’s important to take a few things into consideration, or natural light can grow from beauty to nuisance in no time. Geographical location, climate, and direction in proximity to the rising and falling of the sun must be included in the calculations when designing window placement. For example, up north, it is advised to put more windows on the south and southwest of the home to maximize heat gain during the colder months.

### 3. Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT) Flooring

Hardwood floors can really sell a home, but it now has serious competition from flooring made from luxury vinyl tiles. Through the use of 3D printing, companies are even able to produce vinyl flooring options that can pass for just about anything else, including hardwood and ceramic, but at a fraction of the cost.

Aside from cost-effectiveness, there are many reasons homeowners may prefer [LVT](https://www.carpetcaptain.com/luxury-vinyl-guide/). It is ideal for families with pets and people who suffer from allergies and respiratory illnesses, as LVT doesn’t trap air contaminants the way carpets do. Because LVT is durable, low-maintenance and often soundproof and waterproof, it makes a great option for rental properties and can withstand the abuse of tenant after tenant.

### 4. Black Stainless Steel Appliances

Black stainless steel made its graceful entrance into the market back in 2017 when a design company created a tropical-themed dream kitchen featuring black stainless-steel appliances from Samsung. It was further popularized by Houzz, who featured the redesign and [polled its readers](https://www.houzz.com/discussions/4633662/poll-black-stainless-steel-appliances-yes-or-no) on how likely they were to incorporate the design into their own homes. Fast-forward to more than a year and a half later and black stainless steel has become a timeless feature in kitchens across the globe.

If you’ve never heard of black stainless steel, it’s the same stainless steel you’re accustomed to with a special touch. Manufacturers have simply added an extra coat that creates a dark sheen. This small change can create a huge impact for customers looking for greater color contrast when remodeling kitchens and laundry rooms, especially as an alternative to true black.
