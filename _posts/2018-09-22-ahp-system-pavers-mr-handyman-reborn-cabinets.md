This week on the [Approved Home Pro Show](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/approved-home-pros-on-radio-system-pavers-window-world-reborn-cabinets/) features our friends at System Pavers explaining how to determine the best materials, design, and company to create _your_ perfect outdoor space. We also chat with Mr. Handyman about which jobs are perfect for a handyman, and why their license makes them the best option for miscellaneous home repairs. David from Reborn Cabinets joins us to talk about transparency, education, and feeling comfortable when it comes to working with a home improvement contractor.

We also have a [new guide](https://www.sandiegoapprovedhomepros.com/blog/complete-guide-to-choosing-the-right-home-remodeling-contractor/) for homeowners to download that helps take the guess work out of choosing the _right_ home remodeling contractor for your next project.
