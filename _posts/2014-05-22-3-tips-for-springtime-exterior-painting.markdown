Spring is a great time protect your biggest investment and take a good look at your home’s exterior.

<b>1) Play Home Inspector</b>

If you are a do-it-yourselfer, I encourage you to put on your "home-inspector" glasses and visually inspect your home. It is easy to find area of your home that could use some simple TLC.

A common issue that everyone in San Diego faces is wood rot. This comes from the sun beating down on wood trim and seasonal moisture causing paint failure. Not only can this damage your woodwork, but it can create a hotbed for termites as well.

<b>2) Keep a Consistent Schedule</b>

Depending on the quality of preparation work and paint, you should look at repainting every 3 to 5 years.  A new paint job is much more economical then having to replace wood trim or the potential structural damages a failing paint can cause.

<strong><b>3) Ask For Help</b></strong>

Not everyone is good at DIY projects or has the time to spare, and that’s ok. There plenty of licensed, bonded and insured painting contractors to choose from.
