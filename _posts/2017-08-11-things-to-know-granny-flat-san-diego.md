Granny flats have recently become more popular in the San Diego area as city codes have allowed for easier building and people realize the benefits it can bring to have an additional living space available in their homes. Granny flats are versatile and can be converted into whatever you need. Generally speaking, they include an additional bedroom and bathroom that adds to the overall value of your home. Depending on what you chose your granny flat to be, the value of your home can increase up to 60%.

Multigenerational housing is increasing yearly due to the growing costs of homes in the San Diego area. Professionals agree that the best way to start thinking of future parents, grandparents, or even returning college students is now. Whether you chose to rent the space out or have family members move in, the top priority is typically privacy. Building a granny flat allows the occupant and the original resident independence within the property, while still allowing the opportunity to feel like a unified household.

There are several things to consider before [building a granny flat in San Diego](san-diego-in-law-suites). We've laid out the top 3 for those San Diego homeowners who might be considering a granny flat addition in the future.

## Check City and Building Codes for Granny Flats

The zoning ordinance in the city of San Diego has officially allowed for the approval of a second dwelling to a property to allow for family residential use. It should include permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the original residence is situated. The granny flat is not allowed on separate property, but rather to be built on the existing property as an additional living area. A problem that has arisen with San Diego granny flats is the overflow of parking. Learn more about the parking regulations and rules in addition to the city and building codes [here](http://docs.sandiego.gov/municode/MuniCodeChapter14/Ch14Art01Division03.pdf).

## Choose a Location for Your Granny Flat

Choose a location with the type of space you want to build in mind. Take some time to look around your property and decide where the best place is to build or remodel. San Diego allows for the opportunity to convert garages or porches into an enclosed area. If you would like to create an entirely new living space separate from the single-family residence, chose a location that is far enough away from the original property but allows for easy access if needed.

## Keep Occupants in Mind

When considering floorplans and choosing the type of addition you’d like, keep the ones who will be living there in mind. Will they need a one level space will little to no steps? Wider hallways and full showers for your older occupants? If your child is returning home from college and needs a separate living space within your property you may consider not [adding a kitchen](/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services). This allows for privacy and independence but keeps the shared communal areas.

We always recommend that you create your granny flat to have a variety of uses as your need for the space may change and develop over time.

Lastly, the more granny flats in San Diego allows for homeowners to easily cover their mortgage and boost local housing affordability. Time to get started on your granny flat addition now!
