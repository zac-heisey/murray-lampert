Ocean Beach (or "OB," as it's referred to locally) is one of the most vibrant beachfront neighborhoods in San Diego. Known as a quirky, bohemian enclave, Ocean Beach is situated to the south of Mission Beach and north of Point Loma and boasts some of the best surfing and picturesque sunsets around.

The area boasts picturesque rows of unique single-family homes and Craftsman bungalows dating as far back as the late 1880s. Many of these older homes feature kitchens that are durable, classy, and relatively stylish. Over time, however, homeowners with a desire to upgrade their kitchen into a more modern, functional cooking and entertaining area will look to start a kitchen remodel in San Diego.

This is where [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/) truly shines. Since 1975, we've been helping Ocean Beach residents plan, design, and build their dream kitchens. Our team has been [San Diego's leading design-build firm](/san-diego-design-build-contractors) for over 40 years, and [the reputation we've built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGn8ISNG-AY) over that time means everything to us.

### Add Lasting Value with Your Ocean Beach Kitchen Remodel

While you may be content with your current kitchen, your needs and preferences are likely to change over time. You may find yourself needing a lot more space than you did in the past. You may also realize that your d√©cor, furniture, or kitchen appliances do not fit in with the general layout in your kitchen, leading to the need to make a few changes. Once the changes are made, everything fits in, and the final look is that of a space that has been well considered, accurately mapped out and perfectly executed.

Done right, a well-designed kitchen remodel also has the potential to add significant value to your home. Chances are that at some point you might want to move on and leave your house behind. Whether you're looking to do that in the next few months or in 5 years' time, you are going to need your kitchen to be in top condition in order to convince prospects to walk through the door. A remodeled kitchen is of great interest to the new owner, and having it in top condition will help you fetch a goodly price when that time comes. It also boosts your bargaining power.

### Take Your Kitchen from DIY to OMG

The home DIY movement has been a great way to introduce homeowners to the world of home improvement. And while a DIY kitchen remodel can be a wonderful experience in some instances, it's not always the best approach for larger or more complex kitchen remodel projects. You may tinker with one aspect of kitchen design and end up compromising others, which essentially creates imbalances and doesn't give you the end result you're going for.

Your best bet is to seek out a reputable design-build firm, as opposed to searching for an architect, contractor, sub-contractors, and vendors on your own. Working with a seasoned, [industry-recognized professional](/murray-lampert-recognized-among-north-americas-best) design-build firm like Murray Lampert ensures that your project will be seamlessly managed from start to finish by true professionals. Best of all, your dedicated Project Manager will keep you in the loop and gather feedback from you throughout the entire process.
