    and why you want it. If it's too costly, we'll offer you a couple of alternatives
    to choose from. We treat the design and build as a collaborative process.</p><p><strong>WE'VE
    GOT YOUR BACK.</strong><br>This may be the first renovation project you've gone
    through. But you can relax, as we'll be there with you every step of the way.
    We'll let you know what to expect and how much it will cost before any building
    begins.</p><p><strong>WE DON'T SELL, WE EDUCATE.</strong><br>We're never going
    to lay a heavy sales trip on you. Instead, we'll listen to you, and then offer
    some suggestions at a variety of price points. The final decision is up to you.
    No upselling and we are not change order driven.</p><p><strong>WE WORK WITH YOUR
    BUDGET.<br></strong>There aren't going to be any surprises at the end of your
    project. Sure, you might fall in love with a tile that is a little beyond your
    budget. But we'll let you know and even try to make up for it in other portions
    of the project.</p><p><strong>WE BELIEVE IN ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIPS.</strong><br>You'll
    have the same architect, interior designer, and project manager for the duration
    of your project. That way, they know every detail of your project, and the reasons
    why certain choices were made. This provides you with a more proactive service
    and greater continuity. You are backed by Gregg Cantor and Rachel Cantor, the
    3rd and 4th generations in the family business.</p><p><strong>YOU BENEFIT FROM
    OUR EXPERIENCE.</strong><br>Since we were established in 1975, we've learned a
    thing or two along the way. We can usually spot a situation before it becomes
    a costly problem, and we are always considerate of our clients budget.</p>"
