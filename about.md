    IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING SKILL.<br></strong>We know that you want to be
    heard. Whether it's about your preference of plumbing fixtures or the best time
    to have a recap meeting, we will proactively listen to you.</p><p><strong>DO THE
    RIGHT THING.<br></strong>You can count on the Murray Lampert team to do the right
    thing. We don't believe in making empty promises just to get you to sign a contract.
    Our goal is to be completely upfront and honest about what to expect. And if we
    foresee a possible challenge, we will work together to find the best solution.</p><p><strong>BUYING
    POWER WITH PERSONALIZED SERVICE.<br></strong>When you meet with your team, the
    principals of our company will be there, as well as an architect, interior designer,
    and project manager. We're large enough to handle any project you need, including
    home construction, but we're not like other firms with the high overhead of fancy
    showrooms. We're also small enough that you'll have the same team working on your
    project the entire time, as well as the involvement of the company principals
    all along the way.</p><p><strong>WE TAKE FAMILY SERIOUSLY.<br></strong>We're a
    family-owned business and this family feeling pervades our partnerships with our
    team, trade partners, and clients. And by the time we're done with your project,
    you'll feel like family too.</p>"
