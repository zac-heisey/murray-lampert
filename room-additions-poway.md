Poway is a San Diego city also known as 'The City in the Country' due to its agricultural roots. Its population numbers around 50,077 residents (as of 2016). A variety of green spaces make Poway a perfect place for outdoor cultural and recreational activities. Sights such as the Old Poway Park, [Blue Sky Ecological Reserve](http://www.blueskyreserve.org/), and Poway Community Park are among the most famous.

Poway is a vibrant community with a steadily increasing population, which means limited residential space and rising construction costs. For Poway residents looking to increase square footage without having to move, a [room or home addition](/san-diego-room-additions) from Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel can work beautifully.
