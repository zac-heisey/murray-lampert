The need for additional space is not only understandable with growing families, but also for everyone who needs an extra room for a master suite, home office or bathroom additions. Perhaps you need extra space to serve as storage or any other purpose. With a variety of client needs we have met over the years, we at Murray Lampert are fully equipped to offer room additions that will meet all your demands, as well as your budget.

Our room additions team will keep the process smooth by involving you in every part of the project. Firstly, all our projects begin with a free in-home consultation with a staff designer and architect. They will assess your home and the possibilities it offers for a successful room addition. Afterwards, a design will be presented to you using <a href="http://murraylampert.com/3d-architectural-rendering-services/">3D modeling technology</a>, so you can actually see what the end result will look like. Our designers and architects will try to add extra space to your house without disrupting the landscape and the original structure. Should you feel any changes need to be made, the team will gladly incorporate them into the final design before the on-site work begins.
<h3>Transparent and fair pricing</h3>
Since you are actively involved in the project from beginning to end, our team also keeps you fully updated on the costs. Moreover, when the design is agreed on, our team will accurately estimate the cost of the project, so you will be able to plan your budget from day one.

We at Murray Lampert Design, Build Remodel use a design-build system which enables us to shop for materials from approved vendors with the contractors' discount.

Since we have established a sold relationship with local vendors and suppliers, we know in advance what the costs will be, and so we can accurately add them up to the overall cost. In that way, our team is able to offer you a fully transparent and accurate budget plan. We have learned how to be flexible when it comes to adapting to our clients' different financial situations. Our goal is to deliver a project that is within you budget, but still a high-quality one.
