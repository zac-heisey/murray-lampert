Encinitas is a lively San Diego community situated along 6 miles of Pacific coastline. The terrain is slightly hilly with natural stream channels and wetland. This friendly area hosts some of San Diego’s popular music and art festivals, such as [iPalpiti Festival](http://www.ipalpiti.org/), featuring young instrumental soloists, as well as the exciting Encinitas Art Festival. Encinitas offers something for everyone, from ocean activities to cultural and artistic events.

Being an environmentally-conscious San Diego community, Encinitas is a place where its citizens are encouraged to explore [green building options](/san-diego-green-home-construction) through the [Green Building Incentive Program](http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/pds/greenbuildings.html), which offers guidance and financial support.

This comes in very handy if you are an Encinitas resident and are thinking of making improvements to your home that would involve building. An attractive option to add more space and minimize the building costs are home and room additions.
