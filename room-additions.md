Whether you need a family room, great room, a new bedroom addition, a master suite, or a home office, Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel’s San Diego room addition services will design and build your room addition to meet your needs and budget.

As a **room and home addition contractor in San Diego**, our service begins with an in-home consultation by one of our residential designers. We believe the only way provide you with an accurate quote is by creating a design. After we discuss your needs and enter into a design agreement a customized plan to meet your needs and budget is carefully created. We then accurately design and price your project down to the finish details.

## San Diego Home and Room Additions

With our room addition remodeling service, you know how much your improvements will cost.  A common cause of dissatisfaction is when contractors do not properly budget for the caliber of fixtures and finishes.  Some room addition contractors intentionally come in with low priced fixtures and finishes to win a project. Later on they make up for the shortfall by accelerating change orders.  The design/build system [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/) uses will assist you in shopping for materials through our approved vendors with our contractors’ discount. This adds value and minimizes surprises so your project finishes on time and within budget.

> "We hired Gregg and all the folks at Murray Lampert for our remodel and we were extremely pleased with their professionalism, communication, and quality of work. The design process was handled very well. Frank, the architect, and Gregg worked together to come up with plans that were practical and aesthetically pleasing without breaking the bank." – _RON &amp; LISA - SAN DIEGO_
