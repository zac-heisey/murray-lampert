  content: "<h6>Our Process</h6><h2>Design-build is a better building experience.</h2><p>What's
    the biggest advantage in selecting a design-build firm? Improved communication.
    When you work with a design-build firm like Murray Lampert, you will enjoy a single
    point of contract for everything from architectural and design aspects to the
    engineering and construction work. You'll avoid the stressful role of being the
    middleman between the architect, the contractor, and the sub-contractors. We'll
    deliver a smoother project, better communication, reduced timeline, and more bang
    for your budget.</p><p>The entire design-build process is a conversation about
    what your needs are and how we can make that happen.</p>"

        heading: Design
        content: "<p>Our architect will collaborate with you to home in on your wants
          and produce the right design. You'll be able to visualize what your future
          home will look like with detailed renderings and realistic 3D walkthroughs.
          We'll bring in our trade partners, conduct inspections of lead, mold, and
          asbestos, and send a camera down the sewer lines. We do this upfront to
          reduct any surprises later in the project. The final goal: you will know
          exactly what to expect and you'll receive a precise quote.</p>"

        content: "<p>Once the design has been approved by you, we'll prepare the construction
          documents and the architectural engineering designs, and we'll submit the
          plans to the city for permitting. We don't outsource any of this to a third
          party, and we keep you updated throughout. At the same time, your interior
          designer will work with you to select details like tiles, flooring, paint
          colors, cabinets, and finishes.</p>"

          can expect weekly progress meetings with your project manager and almost
          daily email updates with photos. Because we handle all aspects of the construction,
          you can expect rapid progress.</p>"

          We make sure that the doors and cabinet drawers close easily, and we check
          to see if anything else needs to be done. We also conduct a post-construction
          meeting, during which we ask how we did and what we could do better. You
          will also enjoy our generous 5-year warranty, because we stand the quality
          of our work.</p>"
