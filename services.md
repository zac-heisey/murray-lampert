## Murray Lampert San Diego Design, Build, and Remodel Services

Murray Lampert has been at the forefront of innovation in the home remodeling industry since the company’s foundation in 1975. As one of San Diego's best-rated design-build firms, we take pride in being able to guarantee the best in terms of quality, functionality, appeal and return on investment. As a [4-time winner of the BBB Torch Award for Marketplace Ethics](/another-better-business-bureau-torch-award), we stand as a beacon of business integrity in the San Diego community.

Our design-build approach enables us to ensure transparency and faster delivery time for services, eliminate under-budgeting risks and guarantee fair cost estimation, all the while remaining in full control of all phases of the project, from design and specifications to project management and construction.

By perfecting an innovative method of project planning and delivery such as design-build, we have been able to provide uncompromising quality for all services, ranging from kitchen and bathroom remodels, room additions and interior design to custom cabinet construction and green building.

### Single Point of Contact for the Customer

In the traditional, architect-driven approach, customers invariably have to deal with multiple contractors, depending on the type and scope of the project. Moreover, employing several contractors entails having several contracts, which is both time-consuming and costly.

By contrast, design-build involves a dedicated project manager who is in charge of coordinating all aspects of the project and communicating with the customer.

Experienced project managers at Murray Lampert will take care of your remodel from start to finish. You will receive regular progress updates and timely answers to all your questions regarding any aspect of the project, from design to construction.

### Controlled Cost-Estimation, No Under-Budgeting
At Murray Lampert, we begin the projects with a detailed budget plan. By having a single contract covering all the design-build services, we can present our customers with a comprehensive and fully transparent cost estimation up front.

We boast an [award-winning San Diego design-build team](/team-members), so you can be sure we will account for all project expenses and troubleshoot any issues quickly and efficiently.

Rest assured there will be no hidden costs, as we will provide you with a detailed payment plan including all the individual services before any work begins on your home.

We also provide a [3D project modeling](3d-architectural-rendering-services) service, allowing us to explicitly show our customers which services will be necessary to achieve their desired end-result.

### Timely Completion of Each Project Phase

One of the biggest advantages of design-build is time-efficiency. There is no time lag since different stages of a single project can be executed simultaneously while being carefully coordinated and monitored. Homeowners are delighted to realize the design time is shortened, after which there is no need to hire a different contractor to carry out the rest of your project.

Our seasoned designers value your time as much as they value your needs and ideas. Because we determine a timeframe at the beginning of each project, our designers are generally able to shorten the timeframe necessary for the project to reach the permit stage.

### Accountability and Consistency throughout the Project

As a leading design-build contractor in San Diego, Murray Lampert remains fully accountable for the whole of your home renovation project. All members of our team are accountable to each other, and in turn – to you.

We are especially proud of the close professional relationships our staff maintains. Their work is complementary as they strive to achieve each other’s visions. Designers make sure their renditions are achievable by the builders, while builders follow the designer’s vision closely so as to ensure it is accurately achieved.

With a well-organized and coherent team of professionals at Murray Lampert, you can be sure there is no conflict of interest – there is no finger pointing or miscommunication, as our team shares the same professional goals and values.
