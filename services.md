  content: <h6>Our Expertise</h6><h2>San Diego Design, Build, and Remodeling</h2><p>Murray
    Lampert has been at the forefront of home remodeling innovation since the company
    was founded in 1975. As one of San Diego’s top-rated design-build remodeling firms,
    we take pride in being able to guarantee the best in quality, functionality, appeal,
    and return on investment. As a <a href="/accolades" title="">4-time winner of
    the BBB Torch Award for Marketplace Ethics</a>, we stand as a beacon of business
    integrity in the San Diego community.</p><p>Our design-build approach enables
    us to ensure transparency and faster delivery time for services, eliminate under-budgeting
    risks and guarantee fair cost estimation, all the while remaining in full control
    of all phases of the project, from design and specifications to project management
    and construction.</p><p>By perfecting an innovative method of project planning
    and delivery such as design-build, we have been able to provide uncompromising
    quality for all services, ranging from kitchen and bathroom remodels, room additions
    and interior design to custom cabinet construction and green building.</p>
    </br>
    <h6>Our Process</h6><h2>Design-build is a better home remodeling experience.</h2><p>What's
      the biggest advantage in selecting a design-build firm? Improved communication.
      When you work with a design-build firm like Murray Lampert, you will enjoy a single
      point of contract for everything from architectural and design aspects to the
      engineering and construction work. You'll avoid the stressful role of being the
      middleman between the architect, the contractor, and the sub-contractors. We'll
      deliver a smoother project, better communication, reduced timeline, and more bang
      for your budget.</p><p>The entire design-build process is a conversation about
      what your needs are and how we can make that happen.</p>

        content: "<p>Our architect will collaborate with you to home in on your wants
          and produce the right design. You'll be able to visualize what your future
          home will look like with detailed renderings and realistic 3D walkthroughs.
          We'll bring in our trade partners, conduct inspections of lead, mold, and
          asbestos, and send a camera down the sewer lines. We do this upfront to
          reduct any surprises later in the project. The final goal: you will know
          exactly what to expect and you'll receive a precise quote.</p>"

          plans to the city for permitting. We don't outsource any of this to a third
          party, and we keep you updated throughout. At the same time, your interior
          designer will work with you to select details like tiles, flooring, paint
          colors, cabinets, and finishes.</p>"

          We make sure that the doors and cabinet drawers close easily, and we check
          to see if anything else needs to be done. We also conduct a post-construction
          meeting, during which we ask how we did and what we could do better. You
          will also enjoy our generous 5-year warranty, because we stand the quality
          of our work.</p>"

  content: "<h6>Why Design-Build?</h6><h2>Design-Build Remodeling
  vs. Traditional Home Remodeling</h2><p><strong>Single Point Of Contact For The
  Customer</strong></p><p>In the traditional, architect-driven approach, customers
  invariably have to deal with multiple contractors, depending on the type and scope
  of the project. Moreover, employing several contractors entails having several
  contracts, which is both time-consuming and costly.</p><p>By contrast, design-build
  involves a dedicated project manager who is in charge of coordinating all aspects
  of the project and communicating with the customer.</p><p>Experienced project
  managers at Murray Lampert will take care of your remodel from start to finish.
  You will receive regular progress updates and timely answers to all your questions
  regarding any aspect of the project, from design to construction.</p><p><strong>Controlled
  Cost-Estimation, No Under-Budgeting</strong></p><p>At Murray Lampert, we begin
  each and every project with a detailed budget and design plan. By having a single
  contract covering all the design-build services, we can present our customers
  with a comprehensive and fully transparent cost estimation up front.</p><p>We
  boast an award-winning San Diego design-build team, so you can be sure we will
  account for all project expenses and troubleshoot any issues quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Rest
  assured there will be no hidden costs, as we will provide you with a detailed
  payment plan including all the individual services before any work begins on your
  home.</p><p>We also provide a 3D project modeling service, allowing us to explicitly
  show our customers which services will be necessary to achieve their desired end-result.</p><p><strong>Timely
  Completion Of Each Project Phase</strong></p><p>One of the biggest advantages
  of design-build is time-efficiency. There is no time lag since different stages
  of a single project can be executed simultaneously while being carefully coordinated
  and monitored. Homeowners are delighted to realize the design time is shortened,
  after which there is no need to hire a different contractor to carry out the rest
  of your project.</p><p>Our seasoned designers value your time as much as they
  value your needs and ideas. Because we determine a timeframe at the beginning
  of each project, our designers are generally able to shorten the timeframe necessary
  for the project to reach the permit stage.</p><p><strong>Accountability And Consistency
  Throughout The Project</strong></p><p>As San Diego's leading design-build remodeling
  contractor, Murray Lampert remains fully accountable for the entirety of your
  home renovation project. All members of our team are accountable to each other,
  and in turn, to you.</p><p>We are especially proud of the close professional relationships
  our staff maintains. Their work is complementary as they strive to achieve each
  other’s visions. Designers make sure their renditions are achievable by the builders,
  while builders follow the designer’s vision closely so as to ensure it is accurately
  achieved.</p><p>With a well-organized and coherent team of professionals at Murray
  Lampert, you can be sure there is no conflict of interest – there is no finger
  pointing or miscommunication, as our team shares the same professional goals and
  values.</p><p><strong>Personalized Design-Build Services In San Diego</strong></p><p>We're
  spent over 40 years building our stellar reputation with homeowners throughout
  San Diego, and we take great pride in our unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction.
  Given the unprecedented increase in unique customer demands, our dedication to
  personalized customer service becomes more important than ever.</p><p>Our design-build
  process enables our team to craft completely customized solutions that fit perfectly
  with each client's vision, goals, and budget. From planning to permits, architectural
  decisions to interior design, all the way through to project management and construction,
  Murray Lampert provides a fully customized experience and personal touch with
