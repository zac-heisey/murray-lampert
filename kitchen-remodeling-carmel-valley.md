Being a suburban planned community, Carmel Valley is a real-estate haven. Bustling with shops and restaurants, commercial offices and residential areas planned specifically for this modern San Diego community, Carmel Valley is a peaceful and welcoming place.

Due to its mild climate and geographic position, it is favorable to red wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. One of the most popular wine tasting spots is the Chateau Julien Winery and tasting room. The French-style Chateau that houses the winery is Carmel Valley’s distinct landmark.

Carmel Valley residents are quite sporty, and they enjoy a variety of recreational activities, including golf, tennis and horseback riding. Their healthy lifestyle is reflected in the ways they strive to enhance the functionality of their homes, adding smart, energy-saving appliances, or taking up various remodeling projects for the same purpose.
