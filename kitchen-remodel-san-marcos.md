Located just north of Escondido and with easy access to CA78 and I-15, San Marcos experiences a temperate year-round climate that attracts outdoor enthusiasts of all types. Whether it's hiking and exploring in [Double Peak Park](https://modernhiker.com/hike/double-peak/) and [Discovery Lake](http://www.san-marcos.net/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/164/1078), or getting in 18 holes at [Twin Oaks Golf Course](https://www.jcgolf.com/san-diego-golf-courses/twin-oaks/), San Marcos has something for everyone.

In this idyllic San Diego community, the focus is on pleasure and enjoyment, which makes it popular with tourists. Many San Marcos residents rent out and generate extra income, so it comes as no surprise that a lot of [San Marcos home addition](/home-additions-san-marcos) and renovation projects often take place. To make their homes more appealing and more attractive for the sake of renting out or for their own comfort, homeowners usually consider bathroom and kitchen remodels.
