The seaside community of Point Loma is known for its elaborate decorations, especially during the festive season. The hilly peninsula is a distinctive feature of San Diego Bay. The name Point Loma is not merely a name for the place but a name for the vibrant community too. Aside from being home to 47,981 residents, the peninsula has a rich culture behind it. It is considered by many as being the place "where California began," since the first Europeans to come to California docked there.

For Point Loma residents, living in style is a part of their heritage, so remodeling, renovation, and [room addition projects](/room-additions-point-loma) are very common. Homeowners almost invariably focus on remodeling the kitchen whenever they think of upgrading their homes. At [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/), we have specialized skills and over 40 years of kitchen remodeling expertise.

Our full-service approach and proven [design-build](/san-diego-design-build-contractors) methodology has earned us praise from [clients](/testimonials) and [industry bodies](/murray-lampert-recognized-among-north-americas-best/) alike.

Since this is one of the rooms in the house that the family will spend most of their time in, why not make it as attractive as possible?
