[#GivingTuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/) this year is November 28th. If you're among the millions of people worldwide who plan to take part in the social media movement this year, might we suggest a few local nonprofit organizations who could use your help.

The following 5 organizations serve veterans, children, and families in San Diego and beyond through home construction and renovation projects. We encourage you to learn more about the amazing work these (and other) local organizations are doing to fight poverty, combat homelessness, and provide happy, healthy living environments for everyone in our community.

## [Rebuilding Together San Diego](http://www.rebuildingtogethersd.org/)

## [San Diego Habitat for Humanity](https://www.sandiegohabitat.org/)

Most people are familiar with Habitat for Humanity, an international NGO that has helped build safe, decent, and affordable shelter for families in need since 1976. The San Diego arm of the organization works to carry forward the parent organization's mission of bringing people together to build homes, communities, and hope throughout San Diego County.

For [Giving Tuesday 2017](https://www.sandiegohabitat.org/Support-Us/Make-a-Donation/Giving-Tuesday-2017), San Diego Habitat for Humanity is promoting #2x4Tuesday and #BuildUpBallantyne raise the the equivalent of the cost of all the lumber and nails for two entire homes on Ballantyne Street, their newest construction site in El Cajon.
