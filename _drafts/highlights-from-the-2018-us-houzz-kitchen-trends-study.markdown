Earlier this year, Houzz released their annual [Kitchen Trends Study](https://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/101927755/list/2018-us-houzz-kitchen-trends-study) based on survey responses by over 1,700 homeowners across the United States. The respondents were asked about their recent or planned kitchen renovation projects, and the results are very much in line with what our team highlighted in our own [2018 Home Remodeling Trends guide](/2018-home-remodeling-trends/).

## The Highlights

While Houzz included [decluttering](/keeping-small-spaces-organized/), changing preferences for countertop materials and kitchen styles, and the growing integration of technology as the "Big Ideas" of the study, we've included a few highlights or our own that we felt were noteworthy.

#### Kitchen Remodel Costs Hinge On Size & Scope

Major upgrades to larger kitchens (200+ sq.ft.) had an average spend of $42,000, while spend for minor upgrades to kitchens of the size cost about half as much ($22,000). Small kitchens (<200 sq.ft.) that underwent a major renovation cost homeowners an average of $25,800, while minor renovation work to smaller kitchens came in at $13,700.
