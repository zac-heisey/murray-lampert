Being one of the highest income communities in the US, Rancho Santa Fe is a great residential community for young families and career-minded professionals alike. Even though it has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, Rancho Santa Fe is one of the few places in suburban San Diego to receive occasional snowfall. This is ideal for folks who enjoy warm weather but enjoy a white Christmas every now and then.

Rancho Santa Fe is also home to [Rancho Santa Fe Golf](http://www.rsfgolfclub.com/Club/Scripts/Home/home.asp) & [Tennis Club](http://www.rsftennis.club/), as well as the [Rancho Santa Fe Historical Society](http://www.ranchosantafehistoricalsociety.org/), which organizes fun and educational tours of the areaâ€™s history.
