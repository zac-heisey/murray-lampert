Being one of the highest income communities in the US, Rancho Santa Fe is a great residential community for young families. Even though it has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, Rancho Santa Fe is one of the few places in suburban San Diego to have snowfall. This is ideal for families who enjoy warm climate but don’t want to part with the sensation of a white Christmas.

Rancho Santa Fe is also home to Rancho Santa Fe Golf & Tennis Club, welcoming sport lovers, and Rancho Santa Fe Historical Society, which organizes fun and educational tours of the area’s history.

It is no surprise families choose to settle in Rancho Santa Fe and achieve a high living standard. With growing families, there is a necessity for adding more space to homes, which is why many homeowners rightfully consider having home or room additions.
