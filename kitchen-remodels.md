Do you have an outdated kitchen, or does the existing layout not fit your lifestyle? With Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel, you can get a new look by replacing <a href="/san-diego-custom-cabinet-construction-services/">cabinets</a>, counters, appliances, fixtures and finishes with our **San Diego custom kitchen remodel service**.

Our kitchen remodeling service starts with an in-home consultation. There is no guess work. We discuss your needs, enter into a design agreement and create a custom plan down to every detail. You will know exactly what your kitchen remodeling project will cost and we will assist you in choosing from the latest custom cabinet styles, granite or natural stone materials, appliances, as well as plumbing fixtures and finishes at our outside showrooms.

## San Diego Kitchen Remodels

Most **kitchen remodeling projects** require multiple trades such as framing, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, drywall and stucco. There are often modifications to structural walls and changes to windows and doors. As a [licensed General Contractor](https://www2.cslb.ca.gov/OnlineServices/CheckLicenseII/LicenseDetail.aspx?LicNum=458038), we have the craftsmen to handle all aspects of home remodeling. Cabinet companies and other kitchen remodelers are often unqualified or cut corners by completing work without proper engineering and permits. Not only can this be unsafe, it will also affect the sales value because of the substandard workmanship and lack of inspections.

Our custom package for San Diego kitchen remodels includes design, space planning, permit fees, project supervision, and the finest materials, installed by our expert craftspeople. All backed by our exclusive 5 year written warranty.
