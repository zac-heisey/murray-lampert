### Qualified, Ethical, and Reliable

In many remodeling projects, the client is on the hook for finding, vetting, and managing multiple contractors and vendors in order to see their project completed. The process will typically start with a architectural review and blueprints, then a [home designer](/san-diego-home-design-services) to interpret the blueprints and put together a more polished presentation. From there, homeowners have to secure a dependable source for materials, come to agreements with various sub-contractors, and act as their own project manager. It's no wonder that most home remodeling and addition projects run over budget and rarely on schedule.
