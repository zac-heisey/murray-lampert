North Park is an affluent San Diego neighborhood that stands out with its unique suburban development. Beautiful Craftsman bungalows and cottages give this community a touch of tradition and style, which residents tend to preserve.

However, being a modern community, North Park is seeing a shift in home improvement towards modernity in design and architecture. Homeowners strive to improve their homes’ efficiency and functionality, while simultaneously preserving its original appeal. Innovations in home remodeling offer a whole host of exciting possibilities, of which home additions are definitely on top of the list.

Home addition designers in North Park will offer you full packages including design consultation, project management, and interior designing. They will provide an appropriate <a href="http://murraylampert.com/san-diego-home-design-serivces/">design that suits your budget and can be customized</a> to meet your requirements.

Our home design experts will flawlessly extend your house in North Park and complement the design with good exterior and interior decoration. <a href="http://murraylampert.com/san-diego-second-story-addition/">Additional home space can be added up</a> or outside of the house. You will be the partner during construction; you will decide where to add the new room either at the front or at the back, or above the house. Some additions that are common and cost effective include those that connect to the back of the house. You will have <a href="http://murraylampert.com/infographic-whats-in-a-door-everything-you-need-to-know-to-pick-the-right-one/">new doors</a> that lead to the new outdoor room that could be your kitchen or extra bedroom. Such a design is excellent because you can try different styling techniques without having to conform to an expensive original design.
<h3>Creative designers will make your North Park home a sensation</h3>
Designers explore different ways to make your home addition a unique masterpiece that highlights the beauty of your house. Some designers will build you a home addition that extends out and away from the house conspicuously, which is not what you want. Keep in mind that a <a href="http://murraylampert.com/major-renovations/">big addition</a> can play hob with the original structure of the house so go for those designs that involve small pieces at different angles to sit well with the original.

An option for big space needs is to raise the roof and add another floor. You can save the costs of roofing and new foundations by making space that hangs out the house. The new floor will be supported with floor joists or kickers. We will tuck in the new small room under the overhanging roof.
<h3>Just what you need</h3>
The construction of home additions is a major activity but experienced professionals can take care of everything according to details, from the foundations to walls, roofing, and finishes. They will give you a chance to revamp and renovate your current home and create an additional dwelling.

Our North Park home additions team uses the highest quality resources and materials. They offer not only home addition service to clients but also renovation to ensure the new and the old blend.
