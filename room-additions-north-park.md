### Make Your North Park Home Addition a Sensation

Designers explore different ways to make your home addition a unique masterpiece that highlights the beauty of your house. Some designers will build you a home addition that extends out and away from the house conspicuously, which is not what you want. A [large renovation project](/major-renovations) such as a room addition can be a challenge when it comes to integrating with the original structure of the house, so opt for designs that involve small pieces at different angles to sit well with the original.

An option for more space needs is to build up with a [second story addition](/san-diego-second-story-addition).

We will tuck in the new small room under the overhanging roof.
