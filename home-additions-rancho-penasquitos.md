The thing that makes Rancho Peñasquitos such a magical neighborhood is how the community sticks together. Every first weekend of May, the community organizes the Fun Run, Street Fair and the Parade. Everyone comes together to celebrate life in such a thriving, friendly community. At times like these you have to wonder about what happens when your family starts growing and your old home becomes too narrow. Building or buying a new home can be expensive and a new lot can be hard to find. In the end, you might even consider moving out of the neighborhood you love so much. But what if there was a way to keep all your treasured memories and your old family home, but also improve it to accommodate your growing needs.
