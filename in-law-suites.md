In-law suites - which are also commonly referred to as "granny flats," "granny suites," "accessory apartments," and "accessory dwelling units" - are experiencing a boost in popularity among San Diego home owners. Part of this is due to [recent legislative changes](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1069) that have made it easier (and cheaper) for homeowners to build in-law suites on their property. Additional pushes for more liberal granny flat ordinances in San Diego have opened up new possibilities for homeowners to pursue the construction of in-law suites in San Diego.

## Benefits of Building an In-Law Suite in San Diego

Thanks to [custom home construction](/san-diego-design-build-contractors), you have an array of options when it comes to creating the perfect home to suit your lifestyle and future needs.

Adding an in-law suite is perfect for any San Diego homeowner who is looking to increase space and versatility in their home addition. Although there are numerous benefits to mother-in-law suites, we believe the top benefits are:

**Added Square Footage**  
If the  main house is feeling a little crowded, a granny flat can add more space and provide additional support for family members who may need it. As a bonus, the added square footage is sure to give your home’s value a friendly boost.

**Convenience**  
In-law suites provide convenience to your everyday life because they allow you to accommodate for future plans such as extending your family, accommodating a friend, relative, or out of town guests. In-law suites can also be used as a fitness room, arts studio, entertaining space, craft space and more.

**Aging in Place**  
Let’s face it, we all want to age happily from the comfort and familiarity of home. But that isn’t always possible if the home isn’t accommodating. In-law suites that are built with aging in place in mind can allow your loved one to live independently and comfortably.

## Things to Consider Before Adding a Granny Flat in San Diego

First and foremost, it's important to consider your long term goals. What purpose do you want the granny flat to serve in the first 3 years? How about beyond that? Will it be a rental property, a suite for mom or dad, or will it be used for recreation?

We recommend identifying a five to ten year plan for your in-law suite. When we can design and construct the space with your long term goals in mind, we save you time and money in the construction process.

For aging in place purposes, it’s important to think about health and safety features that you or your parent will need throughout the years. Popular safety features that you should consider are:

- Bathroom aides
- Home entrances without steps
- Emergency alert systems
- Wider doorways for wheelchairs and walkers
- Lower kitchen cabinets
- Higher electrical outlets/Lower electrical switches
- Stairway safety
- Elevators

We understand there is a lot to consider when it comes to designing and building an an-law suite.
