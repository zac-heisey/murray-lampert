    suites - which are also commonly referred to as “granny flats,” “granny suites,”
    “accessory apartments,” and “accessory dwelling units” - are experiencing a boost
    in popularity among San Diego home owners. Part of this is due to <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1069">recent
    legislative changes</a> that have made it easier (and cheaper) for homeowners
    to build in-law suites on their property. Additional pushes for more liberal granny
    flat ordinances in San Diego have opened up new possibilities for homeowners to
    pursue the construction of in-law suites in San Diego.</p><h3>Benefits of Building
    an In-Law Suite In San Diego</h3><p>Thanks to <a href="/design-build-services-san-diego"
    title="">custom home construction</a>, you have an array of options when it comes
    to creating the perfect home to suit your lifestyle and future needs.</p><p>Adding
    an in-law suite is perfect for any San Diego homeowner who is looking to increase
    space and versatility in their home addition. Although there are numerous benefits
    to mother-in-law suites, we believe the top benefits are:</p><p><strong>Added
    Square Footage</strong><br>If the main house is feeling a little crowded, a granny
    flat can add more space and provide additional support for family members who
    may need it. As a bonus, the added square footage is sure to give your home’s
    value a friendly boost.</p><p><strong>Convenience</strong><br>In-law suites provide
    convenience to your everyday life because they allow you to accommodate for future
    plans such as extending your family, accommodating a friend, relative, or out
    of town guests. In-law suites can also be used as a fitness room, arts studio,
    entertaining space, craft space and more.</p><p><strong>Aging in Place</strong><br>Let’s
    face it, we all want to age happily from the comfort and familiarity of home.
    But that isn’t always possible if the home isn’t accommodating. In-law suites
    that are built with aging in place in mind can allow your loved one to live independently
    and comfortably.</p><h3>Things to Consider Before Adding an ADU in San Diego</h3><p>First
    and foremost, it’s important to consider your long term goals. What purpose do
    you want the granny flat to serve in the first 3 years? How about beyond that?
    Will it be a rental property, a suite for mom or dad, or will it be used for recreation?</p><p>We
    recommend identifying a five to ten year plan for your in-law suite. When we can
    design and construct the space with your long term goals in mind, we save you
    time and money in the construction process.</p><p>For aging in place purposes,
    it’s important to think about health and safety features that you or your parent
    will need throughout the years. Popular safety features that you should consider
    are:</p><ul><li><p>Bathroom aides</p></li><li><p>Home entrances without steps</p></li><li><p>Emergency
    alert systems</p></li><li><p>Wider doorways for wheelchairs and walkers</p></li><li><p>Lower
    kitchen cabinets</p></li><li><p>Higher electrical outlets/Lower electrical switches</p></li><li><p>Stairway
    safety</p></li><li><p>Elevators</p></li></ul><p>We understand there is a lot to
    consider when it comes to designing and building an an-law suite. <a href="https://murraylampert.com/">Murray
