As the site of the first Spanish settlement in California, Mission Valley is primarily characterized by the San Diego River, which runs westward through the community to the Pacific Ocean. Mission Valley is divided into Mission Valley East (home to San Diego State and multiple shopping centers) and Mission Valley West (where you'll find Riverwalk Golf Club, Fashion Valley Mall, and Presidio Park).

Positioned at the I-8/CA-163 intersection, Mission Valley is easy to access from all directions, making it a convenient area to shop, eat, and enjoy the beautiful San Diego sunshine.
