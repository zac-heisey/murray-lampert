    title="Mission Valley, San Diego" alt="image of Mission Valley in San Diego"></p><p>As
    the site of the first Spanish settlement in California, Mission Valley is primarily
    characterized by the San Diego River, which runs westward through the community
    to the Pacific Ocean. Mission Valley is divided into Mission Valley East (home
    to San Diego State and multiple shopping centers) and Mission Valley West (where
    you'll find Riverwalk Golf Club, Fashion Valley Mall, and Presidio Park).</p><p>Positioned
    at the I-8/CA-163 intersection, Mission Valley is easy to access from all directions,
    making it a convenient area to shop, eat, and enjoy the beautiful San Diego sunshine.</p><h3
