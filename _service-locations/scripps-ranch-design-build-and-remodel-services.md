San Diego has several different regions and communities, some coastal and others far inland. Residents can choose a cool coastal breeze or a hot desert landscape. Homeowners in Scripps Ranch, however, get to experience the best of both worlds. The city is smack dab in the middle of San Diego County and has a climate that is not too hot and never too cold. It is not a mountain town that freezes over or a desert landscape full of cacti. In fact, the city is famous for its abundance of shady Eucalyptus trees, popular lake, and numerous annual events that bring the community together.

Scripps Ranch is located just east of Interstate 15, north of the Miramar Air Force Base, and south of the city of Poway. In a 30 minute or less drive, residents can be downtown, at the beach, in the mountains, or even in wine country. Residents can also go boating or fishing in nearby [Miramar Reservoir](https://www.sandiego.gov/water/recreation/reservoirs/miramar).

The approximate population is 32,476, but the city still feels like a small-town community. There are four elementary schools, one junior high school, and one high school in Scripps Ranch, all of which are high performing institutions. The area is primarily residential and is very family friendly. The majority of the homes in the area have between two and four bedrooms and the median income is $124,438. Family households account for 78% of residents, and crime rates are significantly lower than the rest of the state and country, making Scripps Ranch a great place to raise a family or retire.
