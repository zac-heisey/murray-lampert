  content: <h2>Scripps Ranch Home Remodeling</h2><p>San Diego has several different
    regions and communities, some coastal and others far inland. Residents can choose
    a cool coastal breeze or a hot desert landscape. Homeowners in Scripps Ranch,
    however, get to experience the best of both worlds. The city is smack dab in the
    middle of San Diego County and has a climate that is not too hot and never too
    cold. It is not a mountain town that freezes over or a desert landscape full of
    cacti. In fact, the city is famous for its abundance of shady Eucalyptus trees,
    popular lake, and numerous annual events that bring the community together.</p><p>Scripps
    Ranch is located just east of Interstate 15, north of the Miramar Air Force Base,
    and south of the city of Poway. In a 30 minute or less drive, residents can be
    downtown, at the beach, in the mountains, or even in wine country. Residents can
    also go boating or fishing in nearby <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/water/recreation/reservoirs/miramar">Miramar
    Reservoir</a>.</p><p>The approximate population is 32,476, but the city still
    feels like a small-town community. There are four elementary schools, one junior
    high school, and one high school in Scripps Ranch, all of which are high performing
    institutions. The area is primarily residential and is very family friendly. The
    majority of the homes in the area have between two and four bedrooms and the median
    income is $124,438. Family households account for 78% of residents, and crime
    rates are significantly lower than the rest of the state and country, making Scripps
    Ranch a great place to raise a family or retire.</p><p><img src="https://markdowntohtml.com/uploads/miramar-reservoir.jpg"
