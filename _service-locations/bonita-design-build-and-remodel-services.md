  content: <p>As the name implies, Bonita is a beautiful census-designated place located
    in southern San Diego County. Many residents in Bonita enjoy the rural surroundings
    of the area, particularly the myriad of parks that include Sweetwater Regional
    &amp; County Parks, Rohr Park, and Sweetwater Reservoir. A large majority of homeowners
    in Bonita live in housing tracts that were built between the 60's and 80's.</p><p>While
    tract homes aren't known for their uniqueness and character, Murray Lampert's
