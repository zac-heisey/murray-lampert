As the name implies, Bonita is a beautiful census-designated place located in southern San Diego County. Many residents in Bonita enjoy the rural surroundings of the area, particularly the myriad of parks that include Sweetwater Regional & County Parks, Rohr Park, and Sweetwater Reservoir. A large majority of homeowners in Bonita live in housing tracts that were built between the 60's and 80's.

While tract homes aren't known for their uniqueness and character, Murray Lampert's [custom design-build services](/san-diego-home-design-services) allow Bonita residents to express their personality, add some flair, and achieve their dream home. Whether that involves a second story addition, kitchen renovation, or [in-law suite expansion](/san-diego-in-law-suites), [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/) is up to the challenge.
