  content: <h2>Home Remodeling in Bonita</h2><p>As the name implies, Bonita is a beautiful
    census-designated place located in southern San Diego County. Many residents in
    Bonita enjoy the rural surroundings of the area, particularly the myriad of parks
    that include Sweetwater Regional &amp; County Parks, Rohr Park, and Sweetwater
    Reservoir. A large majority of homeowners in Bonita live in housing tracts that
    were built between the 60's and 80's.</p><p>While tract homes aren't known for
    their uniqueness and character, Murray Lampert's <a href="/san-diego-home-design-services">custom
    design-build services</a> allow Bonita residents to express their personality,
    add some flair, and achieve their dream home. Whether that involves a second story
