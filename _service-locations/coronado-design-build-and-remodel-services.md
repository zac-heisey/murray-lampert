  content: <h2>Coronado Home Remodeling Experts</h2><p>Situated on a peninsula in
    San Diego Bay, Coronado is a small, affluent resort city featuring world-renowned
    beaches and the iconic <a href="https://hoteldel.com/">Hotel del Coronado</a>.
    Besides being a major tourist destination (there are three major resorts on the
    island), Coronado is also home to a large military contingent, with both Naval
    Amphibious Base and Naval Air Station North Island located in the area.</p><p><strong>A
    Brief History of Coronado</strong></p><p>In the early nineteenth century, before
    Coronado was Coronado, the land was used as a harbor for whalers, who built hide
    houses in order to carry out their work. The land was still under Spanish control,
    but 1821 marked Mexico’s independence from Spain.</p><p>Land grants were issued
    and the peninsula we know today as Coronado changed many hands before it was purchased
    by Elisha Babcock, Jr., Hampton Story, and Jacob Gruendike on November 19, 1885.
    Babcock invited Heber Ingle, his brother-in-law, and a railroad stockholder named
    Josephus Collett to become mutual investors. These founders then organized the
    Coronado Beach Company on April 7, 1886, planting the seeds for current day Coronado.</p><p>Work
    on the new town began promptly with the division and landscaping of lots. Water
    and irrigations systems were constructed and railroad tracks were laid. The San
    Diego and Coronado Ferry Company was established on April 16, 1886 with the ferry
    completing its first run in August.</p><p>Lots were auctioned off in November.
    With the community finally coming together, the founders hired architects James
    and Watson Reid to design the Hotel Del Coronado in March of 1887. The hotel opened
    its doors February 19, 1888.</p><p>Construction and development continued in the
    area, eventually including a naval base in North Island.</p><p><strong>Architecture,
    Design, and Style</strong></p><p>Home design in Coronado embodies a unique style
    that reflects the town’s proximity to the sea. Many homes feature classic <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/teamlisanicole/california-spanish-homes/">California
    Spanish design</a> while incorporating aspects of the beachside cottage. The Hotel
    Del Coronado is a beautiful example of the wooden Victorian beach resort, a remnant
    of an American architectural genre that still stands out today.</p><p>Space is
    extremely limited in Coronado, and a large majority of the home types allowed
    by zoning laws are single-family homes. Considering the median home value in Coronado
    is <a href="https://www.zillow.com/coronado-ca/home-values/">over $1.5 million</a>,
    homeowners in the city tend to stay put and elect to enhance the value and functionality
    of their investment through various <a href="/san-diego-home-remodel-services">home
    remodeling</a> projects.</p><p><img src="https://u.realgeeks.media/parklifeproperties/blog/screen-shot-2015-06-27-at-33237-pm.png"
