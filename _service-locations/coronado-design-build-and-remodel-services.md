Situated on a peninsula in San Diego Bay, Coronado is a small, affluent resort city featuring world-renowned beaches and the iconic [Hotel del Coronado](https://hoteldel.com/). Besides being a major tourist destination (there are three major resorts on the island), Coronado is also home to a large military contingent, with both Naval Amphibious Base and Naval Air Station North Island located in the area.

Space is extremely limited in Coronado, and a large majority of the home types allowed by zoning laws are single-family homes. Considering the median home value in Coronado is [over $1.5 million](https://www.zillow.com/coronado-ca/home-values/), homeowners in the city tend to stay put and elect to enhance the value and functionality of their investment through various [home remodeling](/san-diego-home-remodel-services) projects.
