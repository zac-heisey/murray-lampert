  content: '<h2>Encinitas Home Remodeling Contractors</h2><p>Located just 25 miles
    north of San Diego proper, Encinitas is a beautiful, coastal beach city. The city’s
    largest industry is the growth and cultivation of ornamental flowers, particularly
    poinsettias. Well-known for its mild climate and rich surf scene, Encinitas perfectly
    illustrates the laid back, beach-going vibe of Southern California, great for
    tourists and locals alike.</p><p><strong>Facts About Encinitas</strong></p><ul><li>The
    city gained its name in 1669 from Gaspar de Portola, the Governor of Baja California,
    but the area was settled in 1881 by Jabez Pitcher, who is considered the father
    of the town.</li><li>As of the 2010 census, Encinitas has a population of 59,518,
    an increase from the 58,014 in 2000.</li><li>According to government estimates,
    the median household income of Encinitas in 2005 was $86,520.</li><li>Encinitas
    has the perfect mild climate, maintaining a temperate 72 degrees Fahrenheit throughout
    the year, rarely dipping below 40 degrees or exceeding 85 degrees. Average annual
    rainfall is about 10 inches. Although it’s generally sunny, the area experiences
    marine layer cover every so often (June Gloom, May Gray).</li></ul><p><strong>Encinitas
    Home Design</strong></p><p>Encinitas is made up of five distinct areas: Old Encinitas,
    New Encinitas, Olivenhain, Leucadia, and Cardiff-by-the-Sea. As such, it has a
    wide range of different home designs and styles. While Old Encinitas presents
    a mix of Spanish styles and beachside bungalows, New Encinitas is composed of
    larger tract homes. With such a diverse array of styles, it’s easy to remodel
    your home into whatever style pleases you. From classic Spanish design, to breezy
    and beach-oriented, to the sleek, modern-contemporary home, you have a plethora
    of <a href="/san-diego-home-design-services">home design</a> choices in Encinitas.</p><h3
