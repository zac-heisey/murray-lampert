  content: "<h2>Home Remodeling in Pacific Beach</h2><p>One of the most scenic and
    lively towns in all of San Diego is Pacific Beach, referred to as P.B. by the
    locals. The small beach community is just north of Mission Bay, south of La Jolla,
    West of Interstate 5, and East of the great Pacific Ocean. The beautiful city
    has a very young and exciting feel to it but also a romantic coastline and several
    family friendly neighborhoods. On any given day you can find the rich and famous
    mingling with the college kids scene right on the boardwalk. Grand and Garnet
    Avenue are the main streets with plenty of nightlife, restaurants, cafes, and
    shopping. The city is surrounded with water sports, biking/walking paths, and
    beautiful scenery. You can go for a jog in the morning, surf for lunch, and be
    sailing in the afternoon. There is never a shortage of fun activities in P.B.
    Whether surfing is your thing or you just enjoy the ocean breeze, Pacific Beach
    has something for everyone and is the center of San Diego’s youthful lifestyle.</p>"

    title="Aerial View of Pacific Beach from the Pier" alt="image of Pacific Beach,
    CA"></p><p>Most residences in Pacific Beach were built between the years of 1950
    through 1989. Any home in the area is most likely at least 22 years old and probably
    much older, leaving a lot of uncertainty to the stability and quality of its infrastructure.
    Each year, repairs must be made to balance the extreme amount of erosion from
    the salty air. Most people are surprised by how strong the sea breeze is and how
    much damage it can cause to a home even a couple miles inland. Landlords must
    charge higher rents to pay for the repairs and renovations and home owners living
    in their home need to keep an eye out for structural damage, especially to the
    exterior of the building. The weather may seem perfect all year around, but there
    is more household erosion in Pacific Beach than most cities in the U.S. will every
    experience.</p><p>Common Pacific Beach renovations are room additions, second
    stories, kitchen remodeling, outdoor spaces and even complete tear downs/rebuilding.
    Since Pacific Beach is a damp climate and ocean air can cause corrosion, clad
    aluminum or vinyl windows are a wise choice. Other construction enhancements to
    protect Pacific Beach homes from the weather are Tyvak house wrap for a tight
    building envelope, extended overhangs over west face walls to prevent leaks from
    a driving rain and positive drainage away from all foundations.</p><h2 id="pacific-beach-design-and-architecture">Pacific
    Beach Design and Architecture</h2><p>As a densely populated beach town, the architectural
    designs of Pacific Beach vary from tightly-packed 30s-style beachfront cottages
    to large, pricey hotels and condos built with natural, earthy materials. Aside
    from the quaint residential areas that run adjacent to popular businesses and
    busy streets, Pacific Beach holds an architectural report card that runs from
    San Diego’s budding first moments to today’s most modern fancies.</p><p>Primarily
    consisting of small studio apartments to four bedroom homes, the Pacific Beach
    residential neighborhoods offer older, well-established architecture that was
    built between 1940 and 1969. The newer, trendier architecture often found closer
    to the shore can be attributed to the 1970 through 1994 date range.</p><p>Standing
    at 1111 Pacific Beach Drive, one of the most distinguishing architectural structures
    erected in Pacific Beach owes its existence to America’s oldest women’s rowing
    club. The Zlac Rowing Clubhouse was originally designed by architect Lilian J.
    Rice, one of the first women to earn a degree in architecture from the University
    of California Berkeley in 1910.</p><p>The work of architect John Mock is visible
    throughout Pacific Beach in the many apartment complexes built during his time.
    Mock is responsible for architectural apartment outcroppings, and was recognized
    during his time for his omni-directional architecture that incorporated form,
    function and economy.</p><p>Tower 23 is another shining star of Pacific Beach
    Architecture. This hotel is a stylish, contemporary, and luxurious urban building
    that brings in the natural elements around it with glass-boxed architecture. Designer
    and architect Graham Downes built this hotel and restaurant to bring in the tropical
    surroundings and play up the beauty of the natural atmosphere. Another tropical
    architectural gem is The Catamaran Hotel, which incorporates strong colonial Hawaiian
    architecture and tropical design that is carried throughout the hotel.</p><p><img

    title="Tower 23 Hotel in Paciic Beach" alt="image of Tower 23 in Pacific Beach
    at sunset"></p><p>Pacific Beach is also home to new styles of architecture. Many
    of the most recently built residences are multi-million dollar houses with spiral
    staircases, infinity pools, and theater rooms that show off the latest in ultramodern
    styles.</p><p>From practical apartment complexes to luxurious hotels with tropical
    themes, Pacific Beach architecture and home design provides an interesting reflection
    on the area’s history and growth.</p><h3 id="pacific-beach-home-remodeling-by-murray-lampert">Pacific
