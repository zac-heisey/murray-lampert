  content: <h2>Home Design &amp; Remodeling in La Mesa</h2><p>La Mesa is a city in
    San Diego County and is inland, about twelve miles east of the Pacific Ocean.
    Because of this distance from the coast, temperatures are generally warmer and
    dryer than the weather that people might traditionally associate with San Diego.</p><p>The
    city is bordered on the west and north by the city of San Diego, Spring Valley
    and Lemon Grove on the south, and El Cajon on the east.</p><p><strong>A Brief
    History of La Mesa</strong></p><p>In Spanish, La Mesa means “the table” or “the
    plateau”, a reference to the area’s geography. After Spanish colonization, the
    area that is now La Mesa became part of <a href="http://www.missionsandiego.org/">Mission
    San Diego de Alcala</a>. Following Mexico’s independence and the division of Californian
    land, Robert Allison arrived in San Diego and purchased 4,000 acres of land, which
    is now part of south La Mesa.</p><p><img src="https://www.californiabeaches.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mission-San-Diego-Bryce-apr16-12-1000x692.jpg"
    title="Mission San Diego de Alcala" alt="image of Mission San Diego de Alcala
    in La Mesa"></p><p>The construction of railroads caused massive growth in 1885.
    John Harbison purchased 4,000 acres of land from the Arguello estate. In 1887,
    the San Diego Flume Company purchased Harbison’s land and filed a subdivision
    map. The area was named La Mesa Colony. The year 1894 marked a major growth period.
    A.S. Crowder and Joseph Allison filed the La Mesa Springs subdivision map. Streets
    were graded. The La Mesa Store and blacksmith shop were built near current La
    Mesa Boulevard.</p><p>In 1906, Sherman Grable purchased 100 acres of land in the
    Date Avenue area from David Collier, a local land developer. Along with Charles
    Park, Grable formed the Park-Grable Investment Company, developing 200 acres into
    1000 lots. The city was officially incorporated February 16, 1912.</p><p><strong>Population
    Over the Years</strong></p><ul><li>La Mesa began with a mere handful of people.
    By the time it was incorporated, the city boasted a healthy 700 residents.</li><li>After
    World War I, the population grew to 1,600.</li><li>With the business area’s
    further expansion east and west after both World Wars, the city became home to
    11,000 people in 1950.</li><li>By 1960, the population more than doubled
    to 30,000 citizens.</li><li>Today, nearly 60,000 live in La Mesa.</li></ul><p><strong>Style
    of Homes</strong></p><p>Much of the city still retains the look and design of
    its Spanish-Californian roots. The homes are no different, reflecting the history
    of the land and the traditional functionality of the times. Many <a href="http://www.murraylampert.com/index.php">home
    design</a> and contracting companies draw off of these historical influences while
    still including a modern look and feel.</p><p><a href="/about-murray-lampert-design-build-remodel">Murray
