### How It Works

The first stage in all our Chula Vista home remodel projects is [design development](/san-diego-home-design-services). This is a collaborative process between the client and our staff architect. The clients first have a one-on-one meeting with the architect, who guides them through the design possibilities and tries to incorporate the client’s input. This stage is extremely important as it helps the team establish your needs, style, preferences and budget. In order to make sure everything goes according to plan, we keep in touch with you throughout the whole time via telephone, email or in-person consultations.
