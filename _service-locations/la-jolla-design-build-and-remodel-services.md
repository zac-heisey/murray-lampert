The seaside community of La Jolla occupies seven miles of pristine Pacific coastline, and is one of San Diego’s more well-known and upscale neighborhoods. With its unique shops, divine eateries and beautiful coastal views, La Jolla has become widely popular for its cozy, yet classy nature.

**La Jolla Architectural Style**
Much of La Jolla follows the Ranch and Spanish Mediterranean style of home architecture, with condos taking on a neo-Italian Tuscan style. There is only one high-rise in La Jolla, built right before the height limit went into effect in the 1970s. This limit has given way to a more collected feel, creating an intimate environment despite the high value of the homes found here.

The grand hotels of La Jolla include Spanish Colonial gems such as the La Valencia and the Grande Colonial, La Jolla’s oldest hotel where the first sprinkler system west of the Mississippi can be found. A smaller throwback to the area’s roots comes in the form of the unassuming Redwood Hollow craftsman garden guest cottages.

One very notable home in La Jolla owes its existence to Jonathan Segal. Known for his modern architecture, Segal created [The Prospect House](http://www.californiahomedesign.com/trending/2011/08/18/homes-we-love-jonathan-segals-prospect-house-fills-corner-lot-la-jolla), and went on to live within its walls. This home was built with an on-site architecture studio, and incorporates steel wall planes and a glass floor in the main living area. The open floor plan also extends the main area into a garden and reflecting pool. Cited as a highlight in many architectural reviews, this home is a very notable piece of La Jolla’s modern architectural history.

The look and design of La Jolla’s homes has been affected by the area’s coastal environment as well as the trends of the day. Mixing the beach cottage look with a California Spanish style and sleek, modern trends, construction companies and architects sometime preserves La Jolla’s historical designs, but often design and build to current trends.

Walking through La Jolla’s downtown feels a bit like touring an upscale village. With classy establishments settled into low-profile buildings, you can get the best of San Diego’s architecture without the big-city bustle.
