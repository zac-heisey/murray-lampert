  content: <h3 id="la-jolla-architectural-style">La Jolla Architectural Style</h3><p>Much
    of La Jolla follows the Ranch and Spanish Mediterranean style of home architecture,
    with condos taking on a neo-Italian Tuscan style. There is only one high-rise
    in La Jolla, built right before the height limit went into effect in the 1970s.
    This limit has given way to a more collected feel, creating an intimate environment
    despite the high value of the homes found here.</p><p>The grand hotels of La Jolla
    include Spanish Colonial gems such as the La Valencia and the Grande Colonial,
    La Jolla’s oldest hotel where the first sprinkler system west of the Mississippi
    can be found. A smaller throwback to the area’s roots comes in the form of the
    unassuming Redwood Hollow craftsman garden guest cottages.</p><p>One very notable
    home in La Jolla owes its existence to Jonathan Segal. Known for his modern architecture,
    Segal created <a href="http://www.californiahomedesign.com/trending/2011/08/18/homes-we-love-jonathan-segals-prospect-house-fills-corner-lot-la-jolla">The
    Prospect House</a>, and went on to live within its walls. This home was built
    with an on-site architecture studio, and incorporates steel wall planes and a
    glass floor in the main living area. The open floor plan also extends the main
    area into a garden and reflecting pool. Cited as a highlight in many architectural
    reviews, this home is a very notable piece of La Jolla’s modern architectural
    history.</p><p>The look and design of La Jolla’s homes has been affected by the
    area’s coastal environment as well as the trends of the day. Mixing the beach
    cottage look with a California Spanish style and sleek, modern trends, construction
    companies and architects sometime preserves La Jolla’s historical designs, but
    often design and build to current trends.</p><p>Walking through La Jolla’s downtown
    feels a bit like touring an upscale village. With classy establishments settled
    into low-profile buildings, you can get the best of San Diego’s architecture without
    the big-city bustle.</p><p>Murray Lampert has provided the residents of La Jolla
    with home remodeling and <a href="/san-diego-home-design-services">professional
    design-build services</a> since 1975. Whatever your home remodeling and renovation
