  content: <h2>Home Remodeling Service in Del Cerro</h2><p>Known as “The Hill” to
    locals, Del Cerro is a centrally located community in San Diego. The town is perched
    up on a hill overlooking its bordering areas of San Diego State University to
    the south, Mission Valley to the west, and Mission Trails Regional Park to the
    east and north. Some areas have beautiful views of Lake Murray and on a really
    clear day you can see all the way out to Mission Bay and downtown San Diego. The
    small town has one high school and a few stores and restaurants, but the central
    location gives residents access to all San Diego has to offer. In less than 20
    minutes you can be surfing, hiking, dining, or catching the latest flick at the
    theater. Interstate 8 and San Diego State University is located right next door,
    giving the south side of Del Cerro a college town feel.</p><p>The demographics
    of Del Cerro include mostly single family homes with the majority of residents
    above the age of 30. The population in 2000 was recorded at 25,553, but it is
    estimated to have increased over the past decade to nearly 34,000. It is an upper
    income area with a median household income of $64,358. There are a total of 10,467
    households, of which 6,846 are occupied by families. It never gets too hot or
    cold, with an average high of 83 in the summer and 68 in the winter. Del Cerro
    is seven miles to the San Diego International Airport, one mile to San Diego State
    University, and three miles to the San Diego Chargers stadium, Qualcomm Stadium.</p><p>Del
    Cerro is a great place to own a home in San Diego. You have easy access to all
    areas of San Diego, not to mention the benefits of a small town feel with great
    views from the hillside. Located further away from the coast, the climate is dryer
    and slightly warmer than the beach.</p><p>Since many of the homes in Del Cerro
    were built in the 60’s and 70’s, it is a prime area for remodeling too. With some
    homes in the area, an ocean view can be captured with a <a href="/san-diego-second-story-addition">second
    story addition</a>. Other popular remodeling projects in the area are <a href="/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services">custom
    kitchens</a>, <a href="/san-diego-room-additions">great room/family room additions</a>
    and <a href="/major-renovations">major home renovation</a>, which can include
    energy-saving measures like new roofing, windows and heat/cooling and solar.</p><p><strong>Architectural
    Design Styles in Del Cerro</strong></p><p>Contemporary home design and ranch-style
    homes can be seen throughout the Del Cerro area. With long lines of residential
    homes, Del Cerro is known for being quiet, walkable, kid-friendly - ideal for
    the single family unit. Backyard pools are also a common feature of many single-family
    homes in Del Cerro.</p><p>Contemporary design first came to the Del Cerro area
    in 1958 with the ‘Parade of Homes’ project of <a href="http://www.modernsandiego.com/Lareau.html">Richard
    Lareau</a>. His Pan-Pacific house was built with advanced electrical options,
    as this modern gateway era sought out innovative design both aesthetically and
    functionally. This trend has been maintained in the area, as a good many of the
    residences are well-established—built between 1940 and 1969. These Del Cerro Highland
    homes cater to the contemporary style and family life with large floor plans and
    updated amenities. Although there are some rowhouses, attached homes, and small
    apartments, the Ranch style home is most prevalent architectural style in the
    area. This type of home is designed to have historically recognizable features,
    but also a great deal of individuality. Custom ranch-style developments are a
    common theme all across the rolling hills of San Diego, and the Del Cerro area
    ties in well with the rest of the city.</p><p>Del Cerro is a very desirable San
    Diego neighborhood with many second-generation homeowners and close-knit residents.
    With real estate that primarily consists of three to five bedroom single-family
    homes and apartment complexes, the average Del Cerro dwellers are family-oriented
    urban sophisticates who enjoy the roomy, well-established homes in this part of
    San Diego County.</p><h3 id="why-work-with-murray-lampert-design-build-remodel-">Why
