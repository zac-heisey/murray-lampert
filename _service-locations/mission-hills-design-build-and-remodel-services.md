  content: <h2>Mission Hills Home Remodeling</h2><p>One of the most quaint neighborhoods
    in San Diego County is Mission Hills. Perfectly situated south of the San Diego
    River, north of downtown, and overlooking the scenic old town and San Diego Bay,
    residents of Mission Hills have easy access to everything Southern California
    has to offer. It is easily one of the most desirable places to live in San Diego
    County for its location, architectural design, and strong community. There are
    several public and private schools in the area and multiple universities within
    a 10 minute drive. Residents in the area have access to mass transportation just
    down the hill in Old Town on the Coaster, Amtrak, and Trolley lines. From Mission
    Hills, you can quickly get to the 5 freeway, downtown, North County and multiple
    beaches. Next door, Old Town offers fine Mexican cuisine and shopping.</p><p>Mission
    Hills has a relatively small population compared to the densely populated areas
    surrounding it. The city has just over 30,000 residents as of the 2000 U.S. Census.
    The inhabitants are well educated, affluent, and predominately Caucasian. There
    crime rates are much lower in the Mission Hills residential area than nearby downtown
    and the county as a whole. The neighborhood is family friendly but has a smaller
    average household size than the national average. The median age is 39.5 years
    of age and family income is over $61,000. The median home value is $382,700 and
    has definitely increased since the last census. Residents only average a 20 minute
    travel time compared to the 25 minute national average. With only 69.5% of the
    population still in the work force, the community is slightly oriented towards
    retirees.</p><p>The city of Mission Hills is primarily residential and the majority
    of the homes were developed either in the early or mid 20th century and many are
    considered historical or “medallion” homes. The city has a gorgeous location atop
    the hillside overlooking San Diego Bay, but that comes at a cost.</p><p>Due to
    the age of Mission Hills homes, the climate, and the primarily wood exteriors,
    <a href="/featured-projects/historical-home-remodel-mission-hills/">historical
    remodeling &amp; restoration</a> projects are fairly common. Second Story and
    <a href="/room-additions-mission-hills">room additions</a>
    are also common renovation projects in Mission Hills, providing more space for
    growing families and allowing them to capitalize on the spectacular ocean views
    from the hillside.</p><p>Whatever your remodeling needs may be in Mission Hills,
