Are your old cabinets breaking down, deteriorating, or are they simply just out dated? At Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel, our **San Diego custom cabinetry service** can help you get high quality cabinetry at affordable prices.

As custom cabinet makers in San Diego, our goal is to design and build a project to meet your needs and budget. Starting with a free in-home consultation, we listen to your needs, enter into a design agreement, and create a space plan that fits your budget. We then assist with selecting cabinets, granite, stone, plumbing fixtures, appliances etc. Unlike most cabinet contractors, Murray Lampert is a [recognized home remodeling contractor](/affiliation) who is fully licensed to handle all aspects of your home remodeling project.

>"I loved how everything went as planned and I was well-informed, every step of the way. It was a plus to have my story and photos in the SD Union Tribune!!! Everyone was friendly, respectful and professional."

## San Diego Custom Cabinets

Our [Home Design/Build](/san-diego-design-build-contractors) system streamlines the home remodeling process, is more cost effective, and is extremely efficient. After the design phase, we obtain all the necessary permits and our cabinetry builders begin fabrication. Prior to starting cabinet construction, we create final shop drawings for your approval to make certain all your needs are met.

Each remodeling job we undertake is assigned a dedicated project manager to ensure high quality work is completed on time and within budget.

If you’re planning a [kitchen remodel](/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services) and you're interested in custom cabinets to set your project apart, Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel would love to work with you!
