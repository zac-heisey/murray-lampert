La Jolla is a hospitable community surrounded by ocean bluffs and beaches on three sides. It is a blend of the traditional and the modern so it really offers lots of possibilities for entertainment, recreation and cultural activities. Fantastic sites such as the historic [La Jolla Playhouse](http://www.lajollaplayhouse.org/) and the imposing [Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego](http://www.mcasd.org/) only testify to La Jollaâ€™s popularity with the tourists.

La Jolla residents simply love living there and strive to upgrade their lifestyle to fully enjoy their stay. According to 2008 and 2009 surveys, La Jolla had the highest home prices in the nation, which is why it comes as no surprise that homeowners are willing to invest in remodeling and renovating their homes.

Through various design-build upgrades, homeowners in La Jolla are able to preserve their property for years to come, which in itself is a sound investment. Moreover, the tendency is to make the home more comfortable, more [energy efficient](/san-diego-green-home-construction), and more attractive overall.
