## Why is Design-Build Better Than the Traditional Remodeling Approach?

### Single Point of Contact for the Customer

In the traditional, architect-driven approach, customers invariably have to deal with multiple contractors, depending on the type and scope of the project. Moreover, employing several contractors entails having several contracts, which is both time-consuming and costly.

By contrast, design-build involves a dedicated project manager who is in charge of coordinating all aspects of the project and communicating with the customer.

Experienced project managers at Murray Lampert will take care of your remodel from start to finish. You will receive regular progress updates and timely answers to all your questions regarding any aspect of the project, from design to construction.

### Controlled Cost-Estimation, No Under-Budgeting

At Murray Lampert, we begin the projects with a detailed budget plan. By having a single contract covering all the design-build services, we can present our customers with a comprehensive and fully transparent cost estimation up front.

We boast an [award-winning San Diego design-build team](/team-members), so you can be sure we will account for all project expenses and troubleshoot any issues quickly and efficiently.

Rest assured there will be no hidden costs, as we will provide you with a detailed payment plan including all the individual services before any work begins on your home.

We also provide a [3D project modeling](3d-architectural-rendering-services) service, allowing us to explicitly show our customers which services will be necessary to achieve their desired end-result.

### Timely Completion of Each Project Phase

One of the biggest advantages of design-build is time-efficiency. There is no time lag since different stages of a single project can be executed simultaneously while being carefully coordinated and monitored. Homeowners are delighted to realize the design time is shortened, after which there is no need to hire a different contractor to carry out the rest of your project.

Our seasoned designers value your time as much as they value your needs and ideas. Because we determine a timeframe at the beginning of each project, our designers are generally able to shorten the timeframe necessary for the project to reach the permit stage.

### Our In-House Architectural Process

**Step 1: Gain an Understanding of Your Needs & Goals**  
Our design-build the process begins with a meeting between you, our design specialist, and dedicated project manager. We'll learn about your lifestyle, space, and budget goals, all of which are used to help us put together the preliminary design for your remodeling project.

**Step 2: Develop Preliminary Design Plans**  
Based on our initial in-home consultation walk-through together, we'll produce a few different architectural and interior design plans.

**Step 3: Help You Visualize Your Dream Space**

Together we'll review floor plans, elevations, 3D color renderings, and even virtual walk-throughs of your new space. This is a great way for us to show you exactly how your finished project will look _before_ we break ground.

**Step 4: Hash Out the Final Design**  
After some back and forth, we'll make the necessary adjustments in order to arrive at our final design. It's not uncommon for elements from all multiple options to come together in the final version of your project. Once you feel comfortable with the final design, our team will move into the **build** phase of the design-build process.

Adjustments in the design or scope can be made early on, which sets the stage for a successful relationship and happy homeowners.
