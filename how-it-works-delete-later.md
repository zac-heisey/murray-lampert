    consultation appointment. A project consultant will visit the property and go
    over your remodeling goals with you. </p><p>Following this meeting, you will be
    provided a recap of the project scope and a price range for the project in entirety.
    </p><p>If you feel great about moving forward * and we are sure you will! * ,

    we would present you with the renderings and 3D walkthroughs of the proposed newly
    remodeled space.  </p><p>Don't worry, these designs are not set in stone. Our
