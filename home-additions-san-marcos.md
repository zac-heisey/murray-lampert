What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of San Marcos? Is it the amazing restaurants praised for their hospitality and variety? The lush parks full of picnic-goers, families, and biking enthusiasts? Is it the beautiful northern San Diego County panorama you can only see from [Double Peak Park](https://modernhiker.com/hike/double-peak/) or the image of the San Bernardino Mountains towering over the Greater Los Angeles Area? Is it the city’s rich history, dating back to the late 18<sup>th</sup> century when the Spanish named the area in honor of St. Mark’s Day, the day that this stunning valley was first discovered?

## San Marcos Home & Room Additions

Many San Marcos citizens will cite one - or even all - of the above mentioned perks as a reason why they've chose to live in this northern San Diego community. Others might have other things on their mind: dear, personal memories of growing up in this beautiful city. They might think of their child’s baby steps in the old family home, or playing with their siblings in the courtyard. Some might think of how difficult it would be to leave all this behind because their old family home is becoming too cramped to enjoy.

For those San Marcos residents short on space but big on community ties, a [home or room addition](/san-diego-room-additions) by [Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel](/) can be a perfect match.

You get the perks of additional living space and upgraded amenities without the hassle of moving!
