What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of San Marcos? Is it the amazing restaurants praised for their hospitality and variety? The lush parks full of picnic-goers, families and biking enthusiasts? Is it the beautiful northern San Diego County panorama you can only see from the Double Peak Park or the image of the San Bernardino Mountains towering over the Great Los Angeles Area almost like a mirage? Is it the city’s rich history, dating back to the late 18<sup>th</sup> century when the Spanish named the area in honor of St. Mark’s Day, the day that this stunning valley was first discovered?

## San Marcos Home & Room Additions

Many San Marcos citizens’ answer to some of these suggestions might be a positive one. Others might have other things on their mind: dear, personal memories of growing up in this beautiful city. They might think of their child’s baby steps in the old family home, or playing with their siblings in the courtyard. Some might think of how difficult it would be to leave all this behind because their old family home is becoming too narrow to house them. Are you one of them? Then let Murray Lampert Design, Build and Remodel <a href="http://murraylampert.com/san-diego-home-design-services/">step in and help</a>.
