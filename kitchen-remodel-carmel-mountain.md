Carmel Mountain is a San Diego community comfortably tucked in the shadow of the Black Mountain. Its residents simply love the coziness and cheerfulness of the place. It boasts beautiful golf courses, especially the top-ranking Carmel Mountain Ranch Golf Club, a favorite of both residents and visitors. Carmel Mountain Plaza accommodates a row of lively cafes and restaurants and is the most popular with the local community.

This vibrant area hosts plenty of community events, most of which are organized entirely by the hospitable local community. Visiting and taking part in any of the festivities is a real treat. There is the celebrated fall festival with a whole host of colorful booths, where local businesses, schools and community organizations get a chance to interact with each other and the visitors.

However, Carmel Mountain really lights up at Christmas. Every December, more than 80 homes are lit as part of a light show called "Holiday Magic at Fairway Village’’, which really captures the magical holiday spirit.
