<blockquote style="width: 100%;">I am a single female homeowner and wanted a remodel/addition. Naturally, as a woman, I was afraid of being cheated, and as a reserved personality, afraid of being put off while the ” squeaky wheels” got all the attention.What I hoped a reputable company like Murray Lampert could do was to treat me the same as any assertive male customer. What I got was beyond my hopes. Murray Lampert actually made me feel like I was their ONLY customer!Beyond the beautiful work that they do, beyond the courteous &amp; thorough workmen with whom they contract, beyond the surprising speed of construction, they will put your mind at ease at every turn so that you are never afraid. To me, that was worth everything.I have another addition planned in the future, and you can be sure Murray Lampert will be my heroes again!
