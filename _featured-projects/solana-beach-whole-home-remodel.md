This Solana Beach remodeling project was a complete renovation and [home addition](/room-additions-solana-beach). San Diego-based [IndoTeak](http://www.indoteakdesign.com/) was used for the stairs, floors, and shower wall in the remodeled bathroom. The stairs are particularly unique in that they are completely open with a single metal stringer. IndoTeak milled the treads and matching plank flooring. In the bathroom, the window wall has IndoTeak wood cladding. The deep wood color with glass tile really makes this shower pop.

Check out photos of the finished project below.
