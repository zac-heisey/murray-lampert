This [featured remodeling project](/featured-projects) was located in Imperial Beach and included a tri-level [addition](/san-diego-room-additions) to the front of the house with bedrooms, baths, a kitchenette as well as a deck with ocean views. The client often rents out the main house and wanted a private space for his family to enjoy.

Their elegant yet modern design was incorporated by combining simplistic materials with more detailed accessories and lighting. Overall, it created a high-end beachy feel.

Some of the fixtures and finishes include:

1. Daltile EL40 6x18” tile in Lunar White

2. Stonemark Granite

3. Crystal Chandelier by Home Decorator’s Collections

Take a look at renderings, plans and before & after photos to see how the process was executed from start to end.
