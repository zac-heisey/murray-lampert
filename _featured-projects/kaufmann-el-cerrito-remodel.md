This latest featured project in San Diego's El Cerrito neighborhood is home to Scott and Karie Kaufmann. Karie is a good friend of ours, and she's been a valuable partner and [business coach](http://kariekaufmann.com/) to us over the years.

We're excited to help the Kaufmanns with this [total home renovation](/major-renovations), which includes a complete overhaul of the basement, a new garage and second story deck, a master bath renovation, and expansion of their family room.

Check back for more images, videos, and other updates as this project comes together!
