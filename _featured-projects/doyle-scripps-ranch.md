project-overview: <p>Scripps Ranch is a beautiful suburban area that is sought after
  by families for its tight-knit community. Located just Interstate 15, it is a great
  centralized location in San Diego. The homeowners for this project have spent most
  of their lives here raising their children and decided to make the far move (up
  the street) to downsize, leaving their long term home to their son and his family.
  They were extremely close to the prior homeowner, who was a dear friend and neighbor
  of theirs for many years. They were excited to have the opportunity to purchase
  the 1971 property and remodel it to be their forever home.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The
  entire home was renovated, as was the landscaping. This included a small addition
  to the back side of the house to accommodate a larger kitchen. We designed a new
  space plan to help create a more open floor plan as they love entertaining. Adding
  large sliding doors to the communal area helped create that nice indoor/outdoor
  feeling the homeowners were hoping for. Using materials and finishes of the transitional
  style, we were able to create a comfortable place for the homeowners to create new
  memories in.</p>
