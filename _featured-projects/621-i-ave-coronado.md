project-overview: "<p>The owner of this beautiful Coronado home is a retired Navy
  captain and son of a brick mason. This inspired the blue accent colors throughout
  the home, as well as the brick-red front door.</p><p>This whole home remodel project
  in Coronado involved a ton of moving pieces. The project required architectural
  and interior design, sourcing of finishes, structural engineering, permit processing
  and construction. We basically gutted and remodeled the majority of both the exterior
  and interior of the home.</p><p><strong>Project Highlights</strong></p><p>We built
  a new kitchen with custom white cabinetry, quartz counters, full height subway tile
  back-splash, new stainless steel appliances and sink. We love the timelessness and
  bright energy of fresh white kitchens!</p><p>We added stair treads and replaced
  handrail caps with stained wood to match the flooring perfectly. We installed new
  white painted stair risers and installed railing spindles and posts.</p><p>In the
  family room, the existing fireplace was refaced with red brick. We designed and
  installed white custom entertainment cabinetry as well.</p><p>Bathrooms were remodeled
  and updated with white custom cabinets, quartz counters, sparkling new plumbing
  fixtures, white subway tiles with recessed niches, and a shower seat (great safety
  feature!).</p><p>We added LED recessed light fixtures, wall sconces, pendent lights
  and other decorative fixtures throughout the home.</p><p>When the renovation was
  over, it was amazing to see the reaction from the clients. A lot of time, patience
  and hard work goes into projects like these and we’re always thrilled to see the
  smiles once everything is complete.</p>"
