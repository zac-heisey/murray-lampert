Architectural design, interior design, sourcing of finishes, structural engineering, permit processing and construction for a whole home remodel. The project included gutting the interior and completely remodeling most of the home.

**Features:**

- New kitchen with custom white cabinets, quartz counters, full height subway tile back-splash, new stainless steel appliances and sink.

- The stair treads and handrail caps were replaced with stained wood to match the flooring. New white painted stair risers, turned railing spindles and posts were installed.

- In the family room, the existing fireplace was refaced with red brick and custom designed white entertainment center cabinetry was installed.

- Bathrooms were remodeled including white custom cabinets, quartz counters, plumbing fixtures and white subway tile with recessed niches and a shower seat.

- LED recessed light fixtures, wall sconces, pendent lights and other decorative fixtures were installed.

- The owner is a retired Navy captain and his father was a brick mason, so some of the featured colors were navy blue for the siding and a brick red front door.
