This mid-century remodel in North Park, San Diego featured a [full kitchen remodel](/san-diego-kitchen-remodeling-services), renovations to two bathrooms, and other aesthetic upgrades throughout the home.

The clients were excited to experiment stylistically, while incorporating their own personal style into the space. While mixing modern and mid-century elements throughout the home, the end result was exactly what the couple was looking for.

Take a look at renderings, plans and before & after photos to see how the process was executed from start to end.
