project-overview: "<p>Del Cerro is a community of spacious mid-century ranch homes
  that were built in the 1950s and 1960s, across the freeway from San Diego State
  University. After living in the home for 20 years and raising their kids, the owners
  decided it was time for a change. But they loved the location and didn't want to
  move, so they decided to renovate.</p><p>Almost 75% of the house was remodeled,
  including a new entry, family room, and kitchen to totally transform the living
  experience. The fireplace was updated, and the lighting modernized. An outdoor living
  space was built to create an open-air room. The renovation was filled with custom
  details, like an outdoor bar that folds down when not in use. In the kitchen, a
  portion of the cabinets were designed for the cats and their food - a testament
  to the skill of the custom cabinet makers we partner with.</p>"
