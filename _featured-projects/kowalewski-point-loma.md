project-overview: "<p>Point Loma is a beautiful coastal neighborhood located just minutes from downtown San Diego. Many of the craftsman-styled homes in this community were built between the 1940s and 1950s. A loving daughter residing in this charming neighborhood decided to give our team a call as she had been planning to move her mother closer to home from Ohio. She wanted her son to be closer to his grandmother.</p><p>The homeowner made the decision to convert her detached garage into a cozy 500 square foot ADU, or “Granny Flat,” for her mother. The garage was completely remodeled into a perfect home, including a full living room, a gorgeous kitchen, a bedroom, a full-sized bath, and even a laundry room. The interior features luxury vinyl plank flooring, navy and white custom cabinetry, an alluring hand crafted picket tile backsplash, Stainless Steel KitchenAid appliances, & Kohler plumbing fixtures.</p>"
