A city with a lovely Mediterranean climate, Escondido is blessed with mild weather year-round. The climate is also perfect for widespread cultivation of oranges and avocados. Since it is one of the oldest communities in San Diego County, Escondido is a charming blend of the old and the new. With a large number of parks and green spaces, this area is perfect for outdoor recreational activities and relaxation.
