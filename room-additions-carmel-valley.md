Carmel Valley is one of the perfect getaways in California. It has an old town by the sea, a pastoral village in the rolling hills, several world-class resorts, three championship golf courses, and quaint country inns. It is also one of the finest wine growing regions in Southern California. This area has matured into a place where people can live comfortably, and many families are being attracted by the large houses, award-winning schools, and outdoor lifestyle.
